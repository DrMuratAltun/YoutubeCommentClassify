For our final project, we have used 3 separate programs to our current results.  
commentFileGen.py, given a cvs file of YouTube comments, is used to generate a 
single file containing all the comments prepended with “[]” and separated by a
return character.  seperateData.py opens the files “dislikedLabeled.txt” and 
“likedLabeled.txt” (the files generated by commentFileGen.py with human labels) 
and then separates each labeled comment in the files into their own file, and 
then into the directory corresponding to their label.  For example, a positive 
comment (a comment prepended with “[P]”) is placed in its own file, and then into 
the /positive directory.  Finally, commentClassifier.py is our main program for the
project.  For this program to run properly, and it needs to be run using at least 
Python 3, and sklearn needs to be installed on the corresponding machine.

As a final note, since we have provided all the labeled data in the submission, 
you do not need to run either commentFileGen.py. It is included to show how our data
was saved, but is not neccessary to run as part of our submission. First run 
seperateData.py to organize the data, and then run commentClassifier.py to observe 
our results.

---------- Directions to run programs using the Linux Terminal ----------
To use Python3, run the command: 		alias python=python3
To run seperateData.py, run the command: 	python seperateData.py
To run commentClassifier.py, run the command:	python commentClassifier.py
