-Cinos

[P]What's the song in the beginning? its so nice

[P]that is awesome, how long did it take you to do ?

[O]What type of clay do you use?

[O]wtf

[P]Eh. Ridiculously long intro, a lot of the detailing was excluded... but the sculpture itself is amazing. So 7/10 video 100/10 sculpting.

[P]Do you make these for casting? Such a masterpiece for non hardening clay.

[O]It's over 9000!!!!

[P]That statue looks so real

[P]Hi, first of all your sculpture  looks amazing. Second I'd like to know if that type of clay can be hardened, I want to start sculpting some characters but I don't want them to be permanently moldable, but I'm  having a hard time finding a type of clay for this type of work that can be hardened in the oven or in some other similar way, I heard that oil based clays can't go in the oven and never harden.

[P]i love sculpting and this is very very nice good job

[P]Super well done. great looking knife.



[O]Lol looked like u was cutting a block of cheese instead of piece of wood



[P]Sometimes I wish I chose a different profession.  This was very educational, thank you!  I probably would've lost a finger within the first half-dozen steps, though.



[N]WOW, the amount of forging??? RETARDED fuuuck, what a pathetic way of doing a blade??? NO SKILL required....

Epoxy??? and spray lacquer??? find a JOB IDIOT!!!!



[N]Two things: 1 the handle is way to square for good grip. 2 the tip of the blade was too round. Otherwise it looked good.



[N]Shame on you... This is not a forged knife... However you finished a functional object...



[O]اوووف



[P]Awesome...  2 Thumbs Up!



[P]beautiful, what else is there to say, other than ur a true artisan



[O]Muito bom !!!



[P]Excellent craftsmanship............ you have achieved the sharpness level which can only be compared with Spiderco SV30 blade...



[P]wow



[P]Truly, thats a great source of good quality steel



[P]Wow l'm just amazed!

[P]Wow, very nice that baby is razor sharp!



[P]good work . but u got all that machinery toold with u . I better buy it from u :p



[O]Did u actually sell what u make?? Name the price if so



[P]I really like your resourcefulness right down to your tooling.  What looks like a machined knife is actually handmade.



[P]Awesome skills.



[O]Old bearing?! You need go to Russia, and here you can see Real old bearing..... So its new bearing



[O]That was a bigass bearing



[P]Ah well it’s still neat, but I thought you were going to heat and smash the whole bearing. So it would be like a damascus pattern.



[P]amazing



[N]Basically just a cut and grind.. no real forging... You could have at least forged the bevel to make a wider blade.



[O]What is that on 3:50? Glue or what?



[P]Awesome



[P]DON'T wear gloves using the belt sander!!!!!!!!!!l!lllll watched it again. Heart got Izzy!

[P]so cool, can totally use one for fruits around the kitchen.



[P]Congratulations..



[P]You need new vice clamps? Beautiful knife!



[P]Good work great knife



[P]Very nice !!



[O]Who legitimately looks at a bearing and says "huh that Could be a cool new knife..."

[P]Nice work mate! Looks awesome



[O]How much



[P]Excellent job. I enjoyed watching.



[O]I wanna kill someone



[O]You should have left it as a bearing and not have cut a piece off and left it so it was circular sharp and its circular so when you throw it gets stuck



[P]Amazing!



[P]Very nice



[O]I’ve thrown away at least 4 sets of bearings like that over the years. I guess you could go to the local scrap yard and purchase some or maybe a local mechanics shop.



[P]Beautiful work and great skill you have



[P]Wonderful



[P]Wowwww



[P]I need the same knife!



[P]Lovely!!! great job, thanks for the video, Gus



[P]You are a pure artist.



[P]Wow that is so cool!



[O]In the words of sensei Doug Marcaida: it will cut



[P]Nice work, i like it



[P]What's with the mask? Never seen that!



[P]GREAT JOB,GREAT SKILL.



[P]Very impressive and entertaining but (I wonder) how did he know that the metal in the bearing would be suitable for a high-quality knife.



[P]Just awesome



[O]Can i buy it ?



[P]Great



[P]i want to buy couple knives from you let make contact ok

[O]Класс 



[P]Face reveal! :D Nice work 



[P]Just lovely



[P]nicely done, I made a knife out of a railroad spike that turned out really cool, I heated up the hilt and put it in a vise and twisted it for the handle and the remainder I heated and stretched into the blade, so the spike still has the original head on it, heated oil bathed and tempered.



[P]Try for forged in u surely win it



[P]4th

[O]Nice, but how do you make a bearing out of a knife?



[O]Your works are awesome

[P]i want to buy this product



[O]that edge tho



[P]great work..



[P]I really liked your approach; use materials that were scrap (bearing), employ home made tools (belt sander), clever use of existing tools (home oven to finish heat treat), demonstrating great skill of hand. Overall, a really nice result and you've shown us that we don't need expensive tools and materials!



[P]good job!



[O]Here is a good one now how about making a bearing out of an old knife

[P]Very very good!



[P]Beautifully done mate!



[P]Great!



[O]hmmm, would the same piece of the bearing be good for a chakram?? now THAT'S a challenge!!!



[O]Would like a traker knife how much for one made



[O]Very thick knife



[O]That's bearing HOUSING, not a bearing.  Just sayin'.



[P]i still can't believe he just made this by himself!



[P]What a kraft man ship, very nice to watch

[O]12th!



[P]great job! bro...;)



[O]Since you heated it in that carbon fire you changed the chemical makeup so you may as well have used cold roll. See how easy that drill went through it. Try that on the piece you did not carbonize.



[P]Looks very nice! Thank you.



[P]Good job!!!



[P]Wonderful

[O]I swear everyone’s just making the exact same style of knife at the moment....



[O]Kawał ostrego skur**syna!



[P]A beautifully crafted tool, one that I would appreciate as a maker of wooden toys....



[P]beautiful work dr.



[P]At the start I was like "WTH is this guy doing" I won't leave a like. Watched it till the end and I have to say that its amazing. Well done!!!



[P]Old Outer Bearing Race. I wanted to see him do this with the bearings. Still good work better that I ever did with a cutting torch and a grinder.

[P]That is a very very nice knife. I love it. The finish....excellent. Well done,....no question.



[P]You're a fuckin artist!! dude this is so cool. Do you think you could do a tutorial on making a simple handle? I've got a Damascus blade but i'm not sure what to make the handle out of or even how to really do it. My dad builds kitchens so he has all the tools to do it (except the band saw and sander). 



Also what oil is that you use? 10w40 or something?



[P]very good indeed.



[P]Very nice



[P]Very nice ,where do I buy a knife like that
