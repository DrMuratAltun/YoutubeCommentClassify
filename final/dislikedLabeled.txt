[N]isn't this a dota card game

which is how hearthstone is a card game

dota is a warcraft game

hearthstone is a warcraft game

this is the same shit but horrible

[N]” Awwwwwwww "

[N]I wasn't specting to say this, but
FUCK YOU, VALVE

[N]the game nobody wanted....gj valve

[O]ricochet 2?

[N]Valve has been an overrated gaming company for far too long thanks to constant ass kissing of Gabe Newell  it's about time gamers woke up to how valve that once were considered pioneers in the industry now do nothing more than cash grabs and fucking up their original titles.

The company gaming company we all once respected has been long dead, and rehashing something for a saturated as hell market is proof of that.

[N]Artifact=Money printer for valve that doesn't work because rhe game is a freaking card game

[O]So that is why Chet Faliszek left the VALVe

UPD: k guys, we need 3.6kk dislikes to beat CoD:IW

[O]Their next game will be Ricochet 2

[O]I played Hearthstone for 2 years, Hand of The Gods 6 months and I'm playing Gwent for about 3 months. I have played Magic, Eternal, Faeria, Pokemon among others. So I can feel the urge to talk about card game. Please make a game well done, no bugs, no translation error, no BASIC errors, and lots of effects and incredible and balanced gameplay. It would be interesting if you could trade your repeated cards .... market in the game, it would be epic. Another thing that would be sensational would be they put beyond the traditional ranked, casual, arena modes, put a tournament mode. Please try to do something standard, for example ... in the Hearthstone certain class has 50 cards and another class has 40, some class has 5 legendary and the other 3 ... It does not make sense! But the big tip is ... Gorgeous game with fucking effects, no bugs, hot and balanced gameplay, it's success for sure! I'm from Brazil, so the translation may be a bit incorrect ... Oh and please launch the game in Brazilian Portuguese already in the beta! Brazil loves card game!

[O]WHERE PYRO UPDATE?!

[O]Why do people still care about TF2. It's a decade old. Play something else

[N]WHERE'S HF3? OH WE GET THIS? OH THANKS VALVE NOW I'M GOING TO HATE YOU FOREVER!

[O]esperaba un juego de cartas de lol, pero no de dota

[O]Still waiting on that pyro update

[N]Fuck You Artifact

[P]That's an epic trailer for absolutly nothing.

[N]Fuck dota, fuck steam, fuck valve and fuck gabe newel I hope you get cancer and die in pain

[N]Fuck you Valve.

[N]Hearthstone ripoff cash grab

[O]First Valve give us
1. Half Life 3
2. Portal 3
3. Left 4 Dead 3
4. The Pyro Update
Then we can talk about a Card Game

[O]Remember the monkey paw from The Simpsons?

[O]”We honestly think a terrible MTG Ripoff will make more money the Half-Life 2: Episode 3" --Valve, Probably

[N]fuck you Gabe

[O]So the fourth spirit is gonna be dark purple/black. Cool.

[O]Sooner or later all the small comanies that become big and successful,will "throw" aside and step on their fanbase only so that they can make a little more profit.Hopefully people will learn not to get attached to any of these big conglomerates since all they care about is their own pockets,there is no exception!

[O]As I've started playing Dota 2 as it was in the beta phase back in 2012, I thought Dota were a card game..

[O]R.I.P. Half Life 3. 2004-2017

[N]39 k dislike wasn't know it will be so hated

[N]Valve doesnt make games all their best sellers have been mods or games that they bought out. The only original thing theyve ever made is half life. And i understand that valve employees choose what they want to work on, but seeing a new original release from valve after 10 years and it being a card game is underwhelming. Whatever maybe theyll have cases and skins for it!!! Kms

[P]you know what? let's give valve a chance this could be a good game, yes it's not hl3 or any 3 but it could still be a good game. I changed my dislike to a like XD

[O]Return the infinity stones

[N]Who cares about this shitty card game?

[O]AAWWW

[O]Well shit i out dota 2 I not playing anymore

[N]Not only are Valve releasing crappy updates for their games we don't need nor want, but now they're releasing crappy games we didn't want or ask for as well.

[O]Can we get another Left4dead? Also I think valve doesn't understand that the games they refuse to make will earn them millions n billions of dollars.

[O]Why so much hate on this game? You do not even know how it is! You are not in card games? Cool, neither am I. Many people are. This is not the game for you? Who cares?!
There are people who worked on this, who are working on this and put their soul on it inside Valve, why do you have to make this moment, the announce moment, so bad for them? What do you get by talking trash on something you know absolutely nothing about?

The internet community disgust me at times.

Many wanna see HL3, it's not gonna happen, especially if this is the way announcement are taken. What if HL3 comes out and is not up to expectation and community start to trash like this? They are not gonna do it, there's so much hype into it that getting it right is impossible.

But maybe, just maybe, if you showed some empathy or at least gave the benefit of doubt to this card game coming out they could consider it.

[O]Does valve even remember the half life franchise?

[O]Група вк по игре. Там будут новости подписывайтесь https://vk.com/artifactroulette

[N]Piece of shit!

[O]Half Life 3 ?

[O]Valve : ok guys, we are going to get our fat ass up and make an game, What do you guys want?
Fans: Half life 3
Valve : ok, an card game bassed on dota it is!

[N]Yay, more of those damn card games for kids!
Who cares about fans and their petty requests to finally make HF3 when CG virus infected almost every game developer's brain?
I bet in next 5 yrs we'll have card games about everything - starting from pokemons to zombies and ninjas.
Damn I hate Valve even more right now.

[O]Half-Life 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[O]I love how people make assumptions literally knowing nothing about the game besides its format. Come on guys be a bit more mentally astute.

[P]thanks volvo

[O]Coming next: Half-Life 3 the pachinko machine!

[N]Fuck you, Valve

[O]Hahahahhaha

[N]FUCK VALVE

[O]Half life 3, portal 3, left 4 dead 3 confirmed!!!! (Its a prank)
[N]valve are you serious?you are scum that prey on cs:go and Dota 2,you don't even think about their fans,the players,if you have released Half:Life 3!!! you would get......

[O]Artifact logo is a triangle. Triangles have 3 sides. Half-Life 3 confirmed.

[N]I hope no one gets this

[O]Probably Valve right now: "Well we revealed a new game and everyone is angry, we better stick to VR and Steam"

[N]Valve, i honestly want to think that this is a joke? Why are you doing this?, leaving everything that made you great and allowed you to success, just for another fucking moba game with lack of personality. This is not how Valve works, at least, i should not be how Valve works. Just remember the good times, when you always do wathever you wanted because you did not wanted to follow trents.
I am not even talking about Half-life 3, it seems you have never and will never be able to create something as big as Half-life 3.
Lots of people still believed in you after the circunstances, bad TF2 updates, extremely slow way to do things... 
But I think that this time, you guys have COMPLETLY FUCKED UP. 
Just bring the old Valve back

[O]I bet they are proud.

[N]You had one job, valve, one job. We ask for Portal 3 & HL3 and you give us this.

[N]Seriously Valve? Fucking seriously? I'll be happy when this game flops. Maybe then they will learn their lesson.

[N]BOOOOOOOOOO

[O]I came to laugh at Valve and all the idiots who are still giving Valve money.




imagine now all your games locked in 1 library at the mercy of a company that can decide any moment to shut down services and tell you to go fuck urself because you never really owned any of the games you paid for hahahahaha

[O]New information plz

[O]I’m still waiting for Half-Life 3,but,Valve...Seriously?

[N]OUT OF ANYTHING YOU MAKE A FUCKING CARD GAME!!!!!!!      VALVE USE YOUR TIME WISELY INSTEAD OF MAKING A P2P SOLITARE

[N]Gabe, U're fucking faggot!!!Fuck ur projects!Fuck Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!

[N]league of legends it's best moba game ever fuck dota2 so plz just make fuking half life 3

[N]Hello, we like money. There are already 10 other card games that will be more popular than this one, because this one came out way too late to be part of the competition, but we like money, so here you have it and fuck what you want.

[O]Its funny how ignorant all these people are in the comments thinking Valve will release a new HL2 Ep 3, L4D3 or Portal 3. heh, no. The writers for these games left about a year ago, and currently has no hope of being revived in the great stories they once were.. so just shut the fuck up and enjoy that you at least got a game.

[N]valve go fuck yourself

[O]NEW SOURCE 2 GAME!!??!!!



a card game.

[N]why valve?whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!

[O]4K likes 
54K dislikes
LUL

[O]I WANT HALF LIFE 3! I WANT HALF LIFE 3!

[N]Dota 2 literally dying because there has been no new content since December 2016.  

Valve's solution - Card game.

Love Dota 2, will never stop playing it.  But I can't stop but feel deeply betrayed by Valve.

[O]I dont understand why halflife should be a spezial ans good game

[N]And you make a fucking channel for it, just like overwatch.

[O]As a wise man once said: "What were they thinking?"

[P]Am I the only that actually get excited by this? lul

[O]Just tell us how half life ends 

[O]Community: "please give us Half Life 3, Portal 3 and L4D3"
Valve: "card game, nigga"

[O]Fans: 
-Revive TF2
-Update Dota more
-Update CSGO more
-Portal 3 pls
-HALFLIFE 3 PLS

Valve:
-Oh so Overwatch stole our TF2 playerbase huh?
Lets make  card game to steal their hearthstone playerbase

[O]Abstergo logo?

[O]I suddenly realized that actually Artifact might be a result of Valve Pipeline work. For those who don't know: Valve Pipeline was a project targeted at teenagers who aspire to be game developers (basically teenagers learning to work at Valve and game industry in general). It was launched in 2013 and not much was heard ever since. 

Nothing was told to the public about the status of the project. No official cancellations were made. Their website seems to be down.

[P]FUcking love this. I don't play CS:GO and I still play tf2, and I also play dota 2 and now I can't wait for this new game, meanwhile all these dudes thinking that EVERYONE cares about CS:GO and tf2 and that nobody will like this game. Pf, yeah, opinions never existed amiright?

[N]just here to dislike, not even gonna watch the video

[O]AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

[O]Where's Half Life 3?

[N]im here to dislike

[N]Half Life 3 was canceled for this? ...

[N]How did this game even get past conception? Enough valve, stop it with this manipulation and just resale a fuckin game! It doesn't even have to be half life 3 anymore! Just make an enjoyable game!

[N]I haven't been this disappointed since my wife said she'd leave me only to come back.

[N]All I can say is wtf and r.i.p valve

[N]Fuck this bullshit

[P]OH BOY I LOVE CARD GAME VIDEO GAMES

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MOBAS AND CARD GAMES RIGHT NOW

[N]2017: This is the worst! How could you, Valve? BOYCOTT!
2018: game makes a bajillion dollars

[N]Half Life is fucking dead.

[O]This is almost as bad dislike wise, as the Infinite Warfare reveal trailer lol

[O]RIP HL3

[P]Im down for a card game, as long as its not p2w

[O]hl3 rip

[N]I loved your shit in the 2000s but all you did in the 2010s was a load of shit
i want my single player and oldschool MP back

[N]Now i can see how Valve is going just for money.
Halflife a lot of funny,good history,cheap, THE KING OF FPS,YOUR STAR.
Lets Fuck Halflife and lets have more money.
Sorry i was waiting a lot of time for see something of halflife but i got a FUCKING card game...
Valve YOU ARE NOT THE SAME.

[N]this be shit

[O]estoy hasta la puta madre aun no sacan L4D 3 half life 3 y los demas y ya quieren sacar un nuevo juego de cartas vallanse a la mierda

[O]The only 3 Valve can count to is for the number of colors in that triangle logo

[N]WHERES MY FUCKING PYRO UPDATE GOD DAMN YOUR SHITTY CARD GAME TO THE HELL OF A NEVER ENDING 2FORT I SAY

[O]FOR GOD SAKE VALVe WHERE IS HALF LIFE 3!?!?

[P]It was amazing to see colored rocks clash together in high definition.

Edit: 10/10

[N]I came here to see how many dislikes this video got. I was not disappointed.

[O]Valve is turning into Microsoft.

[O]Dota the Gathering NotLikeThis

[N]THIS IS WHY MOM DOESN'T FUCKING LOVE YOU

[P]I like the idea, please don't kill it

[N]Valve is trying to capitalize on everything, except on what their fans want.
Are you so detached, Valve, that you have forgotten who made you what you are today?

[N]fanbase wants Half-Life 3 since 2006 - gets card game in 2017 instead

[O]AE BOSTA COMO FALIR VSF MEU ERMÃO

[O]the only way they can make this acceptable to many people is to actually show quality and gameplay who knows maybe its not a traditional card game maybe its different then what we expect maybe it will will give us lore upon lore for dota 2 or it could be complete shite/another hearthstone clone... to all those who want to get good (non biased )news on this go to valve news network

[O]I’m waiting to see it , surprise me valve

[O]https://discord.gg/22smeV

[N]Valve: FUCK YOU.

[N]The last big company who cared for the fans has fallen.

[N]Reported for sexual content

[N]Its Half live 3, no its portal 3... no its just other fucking card game.

[O]Valve is turning into Sony.

[N]Hey Valve! Maybe listen to your fucking community? We didnt ask for this.

[O]hl3 ? portal movie?





dota card game

[N]Valve made a choice. 1. Make a sequal to all there games making a huge boom in profits and possibly overthrowing its competitors or 2. Make a cheap game that only half of the dota fandom would buy. Yep good old valve they like the easy way

[N]Creation club and this shit ye backstab all good game series

[O]alright, i see a lot of people really dislike this idea. could anyone explain exacly why though?
is it because valve made this instead of something more interesting? or because it might be pay-to-win?
i want to hear your reasons, comment section. not saying i like the idea either.

[P]Dear People(noobs) who are freaking out about this 
Ccg's are VERY CHEAP TO MAKE so stop whining about how valve spent your money 
New heroes coming out this year and 11 major tournaments 
Also  if even 1 seventh of the people who play dota play this game too  it will still be successfull 
Great move on valves part stop cry play u game git gud

[N]introducing the game nobody asked for

[N]I honestly hope this is free to play just so I can install it and immediately write a negative review. Fuck this shit, and fuck valve. TF2 is basically abandon-ware at this point and CS:GO is a glorified gambling machine. I remember when Valve was a name you could count on and respect. The worst fucking part of this shit is that they're going to say nothing because unless you partake in human sacrifice, the high and mighty Valve gods never grace any of their communities with their presence. I'm not sure if it's arrogance at this point, or some pussy childish way of trying to 'avoid disappointing fans'. Well guess what, valve. You've officially disappointing fucking everyone, without saying a single thing. Fuck you. I'm going to make a prediction: This will be a free to play game with crates. Yet another shameless cash cow where you fat fucks think you can all sit back and do nothing and just let the money roll in with almost 0 effort. I really seriously hope this is the game that shows them they still need to try, if any of you buy the shitty premium bullshit that will no doubt be a part of this game, then fuck you. You are officially part of the problem, let me know how it feels to be a mindless sycophant.

[P]this could be a good thing! watch this video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKZxUlNlHAY

[O]The tree is a lie

[N]The likes were probably all misclicks

[N]If this game costs, don't buy it, if it's free and has micro transactions. Don't buy them. Fuck you valve, no one asked for this game, we have told you what we want, and you give us a card game. Wtf. This better be the best fucking card game in the history of card games or it's over.

[N]That's it........ 




Valve fucking hates us

[O]I don't get the hate. How do you people know this is a cash grab game? What is wrong about making a card game? What makes this soo wrong? Just beacuse Valve isn't making ground breaking games (or HF3), all of you are going to dislike this to oblivion? I don't even play dota, and I'm glad I don't if all it takes to start a riot is a trailer that showcases a name.

[N]Lmao this lie to dislike

[N]the 3 is dead

[N]”I imagine this time next year, no-one will be dissapointed"

The next year; EVERYONE is fucking dissapointed.

[N]As a card games fan...





I'am still dissapointed.

[N]I’m not going to lie I recently started playing PC games and the first game that I ever played on PC was HALF LIFE it was amazing it had one of the best storyline ever it was simple without any complications and it was fun and then I played HALF LIFE 2 & EPISODE 1&2 and I was invested more in this game and GOOGLED if there was any sequel to it considering the fact that the last game came out in 2007 and saw this now I haven't waited for a sequel to HALF LIFE like the other people on this community but I genuinely feel their pain VALVE HAD ONE OF THE BEST GAMING FRANCHISE AND THEY FUCKING RUINED IT so FUCK YOU VALVE FOR DOING THIS

[O]RELESE HALF LIFE 3 AND ALL

[N]What a fucking motherfucking cop out sellout!

[N]Half life is overhyped, if theyd release it, everyone who had their hopes up would be disappointed. Why the hate on this?

[N]When Gabe gives you Artifact, don’t give him money. Make Gabe take Artifact back! Get mad! I don’t want your damn card games, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see Gabe's manager! Make Gabe rue the day he thought he could give Cave Johnson a Dota 2 card game! Do you know who I am?! I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the Half Life 2 Epistle 3 script! I’m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible HL2 EP 3 game that burns your house down!

[P]I’m looking forward to it, so long as its a TCG and not a CCG

[N]NO ONE WANTED THIS! WTF are you smoking, Valve?!

[N]NO ONE ASKED FOR A FUCKIN CARD GAME VAVLE WHY CANT YOU COUNT TO FUCKIN 3 DUMBASSS ASJDGH LKJAHGI4GUABGOLUBOFGOUAWHSEDFOIHASKJDFGHBLKJAFHSDGKHBAKLJMXSDCVNBLIUWAGHE;IAWSD;GBARSGH

[N]WTF? a new card game like heartstone? better develop L4D3 or half life 3 or something with a 3

[O]I think many people are falling into the trap of caring too much.

Look at it this way. Why should Valve "need" to be a company that innovates big creative titles? What is wrong with them not feeling like doing it anymore and just wanting to shift their focus and take it easy for a change.

The amount of critical praise might not be the same as before but that's completely their own choice. What they make and how much they earn from it is completely on them. They should be free to make whatever they want and earn exactly what the market and players think they deserve with their wallets and time.

Being upset about an idea that they "need" to make innovative groundbreaking games all the time is a disservice to both Valve and yourself because it's unfair to Valve in the case they want to do something else for a change and can't without backlash.

[N]for the first few days after this released i though "no this can't be right this has to be a bad dream"
i'm not waking up

[N]LOL 18.4K dislikes to 2.6k likes

[O]Half-Life Pachinko machine when?

[N]watch Valve release Artifact 3 just as a fuck you.

[N]Pls just save tf2 and l4d2, idiot.

[O]F

[N]We waited around or more than 10 years for Half Life 3, but you released this shit instead

[N]You can keep your sh*t : I won't buy a Valve game, until HL3 is released.

[P]At least I hope so it will be better than hearthstone and not pay to win

[N]NO PLZ 
DAWN PLZ DONT!

[O]Ok, a thought: What if this is the biggest troll ever? What if Half Life Episode 3 is actually done, and it's waiting to come out? What if this is one big giant marketing gag? I wouldn't be surprised.

[N]Honestly it may not be what we wanted but there is much more in the world we can be angry at and we can channel this anger at doing

[N]You've seen Blizzard's inspiration from Valve.
Now it's time for Valve's turn to get inspiration from Blizzard.

And fail.

[N]SUCK MY BIG FAT DONG GABEN

[N]I’m legit interested why there are likes on this.

[O]что это блять такое!

[N]weak

[O]I wonder how this will play out...

[N]”Fucketh thou who shalt release thy freemium game in place of half life the third"
-God

[N]Kys, Valve.

[N]Volvo, FUCK YOU

[O]get ready to buy exodia for 999$ FN

[P]Am I the only one who's actually looking forward to this?

[O]Here some ideas:
-Remove hacks in CS GO
-Left 4 Dead 3
-Portal 3
-Half Life 3
-Stop adding shitty maps in CS GO
-Add some new weapons in TF2
-Good update for TF2
-Remove matchmaking in TF2
Just do it valve make your dreams to come true

[N]Hearthstone is and will be better

[N]gabe kys

[O]This has Gabe written all over it

[N]What's next Half-Life & Portal Pachinko-Slot Machine?!

[N]#BOYCOTTARTIFACT

[O]How about that pyro update lads?

[N]David T is spamming the comments because of hes an Valve Worker over there.

Blame it to him first and this game.

[N]I want to trade this artifact for hl3

[N]Valve dont care about its costumers anymore

[O]Well that's just great. I guess The Emoji Movie isn't the only one that has a massive backlash this year.

[N]Monumental disappointment

[N]Who asked for this?

[O]Time, Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time, again?

[O]I farted while watching this...

[N]so not even one person at valve thought this was a shitty idea?

[N]You people need to learn to move the fuck on.......

[O]I want half life 3

[N]It's probably not even going to be bad or anything, since it's Valve and it'll have that Valve quality, but honestly if you're going to tease something how about showing us more than a logo...?

[O]Could this get more dislikes than Infinite Warfare?

[N]-100/10 VALVE IS DEAD DEAAAAD

[N]Don't blame valve but only yourself for letting steam going rampant chaining any games people have been interested on (starting with cs1.6).

What they aim for is VR, custom skins, having their hands on stuff you want.


People losing their souls is a scientifically tangible thing that is going rampant within the entertainment industry.
The moral orientation of games is a direct reflection of that.

[O]All the likes were by dota 2 fans.

[N]They've probably spent more time animating this than writing HL3's script

[N]Why is valve even a game company anymore

[N]Meanwhile CS:GO is close to extinction.

[O]Well.. No Man's Sky is fine

[N]I don't know why you guys are so whinning about this. It's just a new game valve is developing based on the biggest community they have right now. Also they probably followed the logic that hearthstone worked, so probably this will too. And they won't release half-life 3 or portal 3 never because of the fucking hype you guys make. It's not worth to risk ruining the franchise with a last episode that doesn't meet the expectation of some people.

[N]DOWNWARD SPIRAL

[P]Oh boi a dota card game. Yay...

[N]This is the type of ratings a teaser without gameplay deserves.

[N]Here's the half li..... !! oh... no, is another pay to win game

[N]Srsly fuck you Valve! You only catter to retards now! Bcs these fags play these brain damage games with trashy micro transactions and other greedy shady practices! You lazy fucks, give us L4D3 at least or portal, half life !

[O]DOTA HEARTHSTONE COMING 2018

[N]Valve fuck you,Where's Half life 3?

[N]Are you morons? Valve was not told that they would release your "Half-Life 3". Why only and for this put a bad evaluation on this trailer only and for the fact that the game is not like your "favorite"? If it is really so much more damnable than a stone.

[N]smh..... I'm running out of nails to hammer your coffin shut Valve.

[O]¡¿¿¿¿¡¡¡¡¡¡un juego de cartas en ves de half life 3 !!!!!??

[O]like si vienes por 4huntedleo

[N]VALVE WHY I DONT WANNA SHITY CARD GAME I NEED HL3 I WANNT MY NEW L4D3 
It's been a long time make game Valve 
When I heard that !!VALVE MAKE NEW GAME!! me:OMG Piss Im soo happy 
well Valve Make Fucking Shity Card game Nobody asked For or nobody wants for 
I hope Die fast and gabe make HL3 or L4D3 or Portal 3

[N]What is with all the random ass card games coming out (Smite tactics, artifact, Elders Scrolls: Legends, and fucking GWENT) and they all don't even look good .....bad move valve, bad move.

[N]come on valve you were better off making more shitty skins for csgo

[N]What is this trailer about... are there shiny rocks like these in Dota 2?

[N]Wow valve; first new game in who gives a shit how long, and its a goddamn card game. Almost deleted my steam account, but I enjoy DotA too much.

[N]2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 noooooooo half life 3 valve puto

[O]before 100k dislikes gang

[N]release the pyro update dam it!

[N]The comment section has becone a war zone of people saying "WE JUST WANTED HL3" and then hipsters saying "HL3 will never happen faggot." which is probably true, soon this comment section will be as dead as TF2.

[O]This is like when people were excited for the Popeye movie but we got the Emoji movie

[O]H O P E F U L L Y I T W O U L D H A V E B E E N W O R T H T H E W A I T

[O]Activision: We have the worst game trailer ever.
Valve: Hold my Beer

[N]I’m sure valve just doesn't have a calendar. Here Valve, I'm sorry but your 4 months too late from April 1st.

[N]Thank you for submitting your report. Here is the information we received from you:

that video is aterrorizing everyone in the world

[N]Fuck this!

[N]It would have been better to never have played any of Valve's games and not have grown to love them, that have spent so much time playing these games only to have been let down so hard by this.

[N]May we all take a minute to appreciate these 44,000 dislikes.

[N]Valve, you suck. Give us what we want already............A REAL VIDEO GAME!!!!

[N]Let's see the current track record of some old, beloved companies.

==Konami==
Alright guys, Kojima left and the community is starting to turn on us en-masse. We need to prove to the world that we can still handle the MG franchise without Kojima's assistance.

Remastering the first two Metal Gear games and maybe MGS1? Nah here's something everyone will love: LEFT 4 DEAD: METAL GEAR EDITION.

==Bioware==
Okay so ME3 soured ME's reputation and its gonna take a lot of effort to win back our community's trust after that last fuckup. We probably should either scale back combat so story-telling takes a better role in the game, or maybe we can strike a good balance between both to satisfy everyone. We have 5 years, we can do this!

5 years later

Here's the Mass Effect game you all asked for. Completely kneecapped story-telling, combat being the only redeemable factor, and enough tumblr-tier token characters to pander to a minor demograph! WE'RE GONNA BE ROLLING IN MONEY AFTER THIS!

==Vavle==
"So Gabe, its been gods know how long since we've released a game for our original IPs, can we start development on one of our old franchises to show people we're still the OGs of the gaming scene?"

"Fuck that, make another trading card game."
"But don't we already have a trading card system"
"Then that means we get twice as much money with minimal effort.
===========

On another note, given Valve's horrible track-record with balancing MP games, expect Hearthstone: the DoTA mod, to be as horribly imbalanced as Yu Gi Oh.

[N]Fix the Hacker Problem in CS:GO before doing ANYTHING else...

[N]valve is dead

[O]PYRO UPDATE

[N]volvo fix csgo fix this game dont created new ugly game gaben i wanna fuck your sister

[N]By definition, a card is a physical item made out of CARDboard, so a 'digital card game' makes no sense to me at all. Can I at least buy physical copies of these cards that will be beneficial for gameplay? If not, Valve can fuck off!

[N]Looks like a fun ga...... Ahahaha I can't even fake the lie.

[N]WE WANT HL3 STFU GABENNNN

[N]VOVLO, GIVE MY ENERGY BACK! Когда-то вы создавали тренды, а не следовали им.

[N]DISLIKE! VALVE A FUCKING LAZY!

[N]Disappointed. Very disappointed... Going to try it... but still... why? Nobody needs another card game. Maybe you wanted money but you can get that from adding more cosmetics to CS:GO... I don't understand how someone at Valve could possibly think that this is a good idea... I'm sorry, but for me ( a person who loves Valve and its games) it's just like a kick in the ass from a good friend...

[O]let see if this video is gonna get more dislike than Infinity warfare

[N]what kind of 4,000 people would want a card game? especially from valve? (i mean the likes on this crap teaser)

[N]YOU play your fucking card game.

[N]After 7 years of devolopment,hopefully its been worth to wait.

WAIT,MY ASS

[N]”Artifact"? That's a weird way to say "Trash".

[N]Wow. Just wow.

[N]dota 2:
-toxic community  
-cheaters 
-full of kids 
-unbalanced 
-killed half life 3 

[O]Where is HL3????????

[N]Are you fucking serious right now.

[O]at least they are honest about it

[O]Ben brode a de estar partiendose de risa

[N]ITS TIME TO STOP, VALVE, ITS TIME TO STOP OKAY?

[O]When you realize the logo is three lambdas glued together.

[N]Oh come on

[N]no no game is a lie game is a lie, half life 3 

[O]I dont understand how people are calling this a cash-grabbing game when its just been announced. I feel bad for valve for getting hated for nothing

[O]Nojo

[O]Hl3???????

[N]Oh, Valve is finally making a new game, good on them!  

"The Dota Card Game"  

I could not be any less interested in this if I tried.

[N]I keep screaming but god doesn't hear me.

[O]REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[N]FUCK YOU VALVE!!! FUUUUCK YOU

[O]Ради это хуйни умер гордон фримен.

[O]WAOW

[N]Portal2 was great, idk what the complaints are about. It was definitely different from the first but at the same time it felt kinda Half-Lifey in terms of the narrative and the exploration. Either way the last thing anyone wants is another shitty digital TCG.

[O]dont hate me but why are people disliking this video??

[N]Fuck you, I would have preferred a new hat for tf2, come on we all wanted hl3 for it's 20th anniversary or maybe portal 3

[N]Where the hell is HL3 you slackers?

[O]Hey I'm back!

[O]Where's Ricochet 2? It's been too long.

[N]Money money money - All Valve cares about nowadays.

[O]Ого захейтили, жуть! 

[P]Great, a card game


 Just what we needed

[O]And to think we were all hoping for Half Life 3......

[O]and get ready after 2018 we will get cs:go the card game (i wouldnt be suprised)

[N]This is bullshit

[N]valve. good luck you know youll make alot of money off of it. but im disappointed inside. we want your games like a crackhead wants crack. our hearts are being jerked around by marketing and design decisions. great games are hard to come by and you made some of the games that are WORTH THE TIME. this just shows us to not hope for anything from you, you have your own agenda and only those willing do go so low as to buy items for an advantage with real world cash are going to respect this game. this hurt your reputation. negative vibes fill the air as far as steam goes. better watch out for amazon man, theyre gunnin

[N]Guys, the game isn't even OUT YET. Stop judging it, it could be great for all we know, could turn out to be aa good as Elder Scrolls: Legends. And how stupid people looked when they hated on a great game before it was out

[N]Blow It Out Your Ass - Dick Kickem

[N]Oh cool valve makes a game no one wants instead of all the games they do... SHOCKER! valve is dead to me.

[N]GODDAMNIT! I HATE THIS GAME THAT I KNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT! VALVE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR MAKING A VIDEO GAME THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SIMILARITIES TO ANOTHER GAME! VALVE SHOULD ONLY MAKE ORIGINAL GAMES, LIKE DOTA 2 AND TEAM FORTRESS 2!

[N]No Half-Life 3...but we get this instead...Valve, I've never said this before about you, and this is coming from a place of tough love...fuck you...get the fuck out with this bullshit.

[O]but why?

[N]Valve, I will bring my crowbar and kicking your ass!

[N]EVERYONE LETS BOYCOTT STEAM!

[N]5k bots to subscribe and like. Kill yourself shithead tub of lard dishonest gaben faggot. Hurry up before i do it myself and torture your fatfuck ass.

[N]I wish someone could go to the valve headquarters and SLAP the fucking hell out off that goblin.

[N]Who cares

[N]SUCKS GARBAGE MOTHERFUCKERS

[N]fuck this shit

[N]Oh boy Valve, you've reached the highest point in your career now you're going down. The fuck is wrong with you Valve. At least fix CSGO and TF2 first before making another game AND NEVER MAKE A FUCKING DOTA GAME AGAIN, ARTIFACT IS GOING TO BE SHIT. AND I BET YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

[N]I just shit myself,
but not in like the excited/uncontrollable way a puppy or baby might,






like the old person way when they tell you its gonna be a "really cool family picnic but really it was just a car trip to the retirement home" kind of shit

[N]FUCK YOU VALVE
VALVE CHÚPAME BIEN LA PIJA

[N]Year:8273 Half Life 3 Is canceled

[O]L

[N]Stop trying to copy Blizzard and go back to warcraft 4, you fucking traitors you left the company which made dota exist, if there was no warcraft 3 you wouldnt even exist, you will burn in hell for this treachery

We'll see what you're going to do when a new custom map turns into a standalone game in warcraft 4 and everyone forgets about your sorry ass, bitches

[N]Wtf is this shit?

[N]NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
VALVE RIP

[O]Valve unlock lootmarket pls, need my money back

[O]That is not a "teaser"

[O]HL3 needed!

[N]MAKE HALF LIFE 3 OR TEAM FORTRESS 3 NOT FUCKING CARD GAME

[N]Considering they released this trailer at TI7 I'm not too upset since Ti7 is an international competition based off of a popular mmo called dota 2 I would expect dota 2 related stuff. However like everyone else says._.. a cardgame? I might play it just because there will be all kinds of lore from the mmo dota2 explained in it though kinda annoying they knowingly have been holding out a lot of lore for this apparently, but the curiosity is there. It has potential with the stream market. Still.... A card game? I'd rather practice meepo in pubs against earthshaker lineups than play another card game.

[N]valve used to be the best game company, now it's worse than ubisoft.

[N]Yeah, dude. This is exactly what we wanted-- A FUCKING DOTA CARD GAME? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

[O]I actually have a feeling that artifact could be a part of some upcoming ARG that...that...half-life...


cries in the corner

[O]Valve has enough money to make HL3



Comes up with this

[N]Nice game, 10/10 prob gonna be an insane must have (not)

[N]It all started cause of Microsoft they fucking made the 100 maps that were going to be free in l4d 2 cost money and then valve has been stong and by them and they got a lot of money so they wanted more and more and tortured us for our money fuck valve fuck artifact and fuck gabe newel and everyone who liked the vid and subscribed
DAMN YOU MICROSOFT

[O]Goodbye Portal 3

[N]And if you see Mr. G-A-B-E-N, tell him I said, FUCK YOU!

[O]omg

[N](cz)

VALVE, your creative way of working at your company dosnt work. You get Payed for making this and this, not just moving your desk, from that point, how manny products you made? Get your shit to gether.

[O]HAVE

[N]Hahahaahah nice April Fools guys!

[N]I’m not saying that the game is going to be bad. I'm just saying that Valve is trying too hard to get money rather than make games.

[N]This is fucked Valve. Under no circumstances will I pay money for this game. Not even if it is good. Too many shameless cash grab card games over the last 5 years.

[P]I love this comment section

[N]nobody asked for this

[N]fucking lazy whores

[N]please tell me gaben is just fucking with us.

[N]Ricochet 2 is better than this

[N]nice joke,nobody's gonna play your cow making money game

[N]Valve failed us.... Well. That's obvious fact now. I just hope they Burn out. Or y'know.... Learn from their mistakes, from not counting to... Oh. Never mind.

[N]No one wanted this.

[N]Rubick Arcana died for this?

[O]So that is why we dont have Half-life 3

[N]atleast we´re getting left for dead 3 BOYS!
So yeah.
still a shit act of you cvalve

[P]There's 3 lambdas in the logo. Source 2.0 is out now. Don't worry guys, Valve is just pranking us.
HALF-LIFE 3 2018!!!

[P]Yay valve is EA now!

[N]All hates this fucking shit!

[N]Hey Valve, here's an idea, learn to count to 3 !
"Learning to count to 3 Starter pack" : 
-Half life 3
-Portal 3
-Left 4 Dead 3
-Team Fortress 3

[N]What are they fucking Blizzard now, they're going to release a card game based on one of their most popular games.

[N]LETS MAKE A SHITTY PIECE OF CRAP RNG BASED CLONE CARD GAME
INSTEAD OF RELEASING SOMETHING FRESH

[O]Who else here to check the number of dislikes 

[N]VALVE 
Plz u need to slap out ok people wat for u to care u need to get the grip of ur games ok this is not normal I will end up like game spy thats rigth dead  have a huge fan base if u keap going this pace uwill get in crysis no money bum dead

[N]Who even cares about hl3? Who even cares about singleplayer games? Idiots will buy Artifact, iditots will donate money into artifacts for paid goods, idiots will make Valve more money.

[N]Why 
I just want to kill my self

[O]Left 4 Dead is literally Left 4 Dead now. Get it? ok. i'll leave.

[N]I waited 4 years for this?

[N]I don't see how anyone can defend this crap. People have been loyal and patient and yet it will be a ripoff of heartstone. 
Valve owe's a game because by now they should have plenty of money from CS.GO, Dota 2 skins, and etc so they should really start listening to the community.

[N]I want to DIE!

[N]dislike me daddy

[N]No HL3 :feelsbadman:

[O]Jebaited

[N]ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ON MY DICK GABEN???? WTF IS THIS? 4 YEARS SINCE YOU MADE A GAME AND IT'S A FUCKING HEARTHSTONE KNOCKOFF?????? DO YOU WANT TO GO BANKRUPT YOU FAT PIECE OF SHIT?!? JUST LOOK AT THOSE FUCKING DISLIKES. I'M BEYOND PISSED NOW. YOU WOULD BE THE BIGGEST CORPORATION ON EARTH IF YOU JUST GAVE US WHAT WE WANTED!!!!

[P]the crowd reaction video always makes me laugh

[O]ВАЛЬВЕ ПИДОРАСЫ РОТ ЕБАЛ, НАХУЙ ВАШ АРТИФАКТ

[N]Oh boy here we go again

[N]It was at that moment that the last flame of hope... flickered, and finally went out.

[O]U P D A T E T F 2

[N]I wanna set up a line of everyone who liked this and walk down it and slap everyone of those idiots.

[N]This teaser will produce more money then official game.

[O]Valve's next game is Half Life 3 - The Card Game

[N]Games? Nah, we're Valve and from 2012 we officially don't make games ( at least original ones)

[O]Que es esta mierda? SACA HL3 IJOPUTA >:v

[N]LMAOING @ ALL THESE HALF-LIFE BABBIES MAD AS FUCK LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
GET SHIT ON NERDSSSSSS AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA

[O]Maybe source 2 is just a potato

[N]do half life 3, get over it you piece of fat shit.

[O]”2018"

[O]Is it gluten free?

[N]AN ACTUAL GAME VALVE NOT INBETWEEN! GET IT RIGHT ALREADY

[N]You can just hear the audience and their sad reactions when they first saw this.

[N]Idiotas

[O]Where is l4d 3 !!!!! I WANT TO BELIEVE

[O]4k likes from gaben's employees and infinite dislike from customer steam

[O]33,333  dislike?

[N]I used to hang on to the hope that Valve is just secretly working on something amazing, and is simply biding their time.
VR crap, cash grab card game, no updates for TF2, no word on HL3 and L4D3. 5 years with no new games.
Now I am somewhat convinced that Valve is just happy with milking Steam for money, and not making any real good content themselves.

[N]Let this sink in





Half life fans died waiting for half life 3 to even be announced. How does that make you feel gabe?

[N]Press F to pay respects to a once great company, the one who gave us such masterpieces as Half-Life, Portal and Team Fortress 2.

[N]guys i got a theory that we get half life 3 instead of this shitty game

[N]I’m so fucking triggered

[N]HL3 died.

[N]I have no clue what this is (juat thought the trailer looked cool), but it must suck if it has 14k dislikes and only 2k likes

[O]Is all the backlash from this not being Half Life 3? It's a new game. Don't like it, don't play it, do like it, play it as you wish, but at least give it a try

[N]They stole there logo from ark survival

[O]сука где халф-лайф 3 уроды

[O]WOT

[N]I don't get why people are shocked by this, valve died a long time ago

[O]Triage at dawn intensifies.

[N]Who the fuck asked for this?

[N]Dont ruin gwent you big fucks

[O]Te vas a la mierda valve hijo deputa ami no me vas a tratar como cualquier mierda si quiere presentar algo no nos presentes asi... mierda que putas te crees carajo toda tu puta vida desde que empeze a jugar dota 2  nos lanzas los juegos y las actualizaciones en la cara como si fueran basura....  que te crees!!! ah!

[O]water
green stuff
red stuff
black stuff

[O]Came here just to see the like and dislike bar.

[N]Fat neckbeard piece of shit

[N]You idiots know that Gabe doesnt LITERALLY MAKE the fucking games himself right? all the writers and devs behind Valves biggest games have left years ago, yet you fanboys STILL ACUALLY BELIEVE there will be a HL3, LF3, etc.

[N]Not a teaser... thats a short cheaply made Sony Vegas intro

[N]I just literally face palmed so hard, i thought i broked my skull!

[O]nuevo juego de valve sera algo grande , sera algo inimaginable , sera !un juego de cartas¡

[N]artifuckit.

[N]fuck you

[N]August was a terrible time for Valve.

[N]Make a new cs and I will be happy, not this lmao

[O]REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[O]No why I miss valve's glory days

[N]You know what's sadder? These mother fuckers made an entire YouTube channel to promote this game we didn't even ask for.

[N]I’m not even pissed that it's not HL3, whatever, fuck that meme, what I AM pissed about is that it's nothing more than a new cow for Valve to milk, yeah cool we got a card game of a shitty moba that NOBODY ever asked for and nobody gives a shit about,  and we already know it will be nothing more than a trash bag designed to put more overpriced shit on the community market for 12 yr olds with no concept on money and it's value to buy with mommys credit card. Fuck, you could have made anything, ANYTHING, just new and exciting, I don't care about HL3 or Portal 3, all I wanted was something that created the same magic feeling of playing a proper Valve game, something that I haven't felt since Portal 2! I always understood that Valve is a business and that it needs to make money, but come the fuck on, how do you expect to create revenue if you push out something that you know your community has no interest in, actively rejects it, and has very little interest on spending money on? Fuck, I don't think I have ever seen a company so much disconnected from it's community (maybe except for YouTube...)!
Just fucking BOYCOTT this game!

[N]You make enough money as it is. You don't want to make games Valve, that's fine. But!
At least should've had decency not to do THIS.

[O]How about moving the developers on artifact to a TF2 one of your biggest money makers

[N]The only way vavle is going to get away with releasing a new without all the criticism is wither to release hl/portal 3 or tf3. Fuck this, fan story mods for half life 3 are better anyways.

[N]I think Thi game is going to be good we just didnt want it Valve probably wants some of the action from card games. I am sad and disappointed we didnt see Half-life 3 or Portal 3

[O]Valve:
We used to make games.
Now we make money.

[N]wtfh is this game;

[N]PORTAL OVERRATED
HALF-LIFE OUTDATED
COMMUNITY HAVE WAITED
CARD GAME CREATED

[N]Valve - listening to it's wallet, I mean customers, as usual

[N]Trailer should at least show one clip from the game or gameplay, not an intro that you will probably see every time you launch the game.

[N]after half life, portal, left 4 dead, ... so many great games, you seriously want to make your comeback with an obvious fucking cashgrab? fuck you valve, you used to be cool.

[N]They made a mistake: their auditory-Doters is the most retarded biowaste possible, i doubt their two digits IQ would be enough for any card game.

[O]Steam already has a card game...

[O]я ЖДАЛ игру под номером 3 все эти годы, я ждал даже после того как ушел главный сценарист игры.... Внутри меня что то умерло поле этого анонса.... и я больше уже не жду .... прощай Гордон Фримен . Спасибо тебе за счастливое детство...

[N]I first met Valve when I started playing Dota 2. I never liked Valve on the first place because of how they handled Dota 2 but damn, this dislike ratio... not sure if I want to laugh or cringe.

[N]fuck you valve you fat rich cunts!

[N]so valve forgets about the best game that they should work on but they make a game that it's FUCKING Like/Dislike ratio is better than call of duty infinite warfare's trailer? Genius

[N]Thanks for the disappointment. Well done!

[P]Well done Valve (claps) Well done..

[O]ДАЕШЬ ХАЛФУ!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[O]Gaben, what have you done?

[N]You clearly don't care anymore, do you Valve?

[N]Where...the...fuck...is...left...4...dead...3??!!!

[P]I liked the video!
cant wait to play this game!!
fuck off HL losers

[N]People booed at the Dota 2 event. Literally dedicated Dota 2 fans were booing this game just like everyone else. If that's not a problem to you, then your company is fucked Gabe.

[P]After 10 years, we're proud to announce a card game.

Thanks, and have fun.

[N]Eli died for this?

[P]nice joke Valve

[N]So valve stops their only original, and most popular franchise, Half-Life, so they can make a fucking card game about dota 2?

[N]GIVE US HALF LIFE 3 YOU FUCKING FAT FUCC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[P]I hope the game will b e as good as Magic the gathering. Well maybe not as good,  but at least as fun to play.

[N]Doesn't have a three in the title, not buying it!

[O]Queremos half life 3 y left 4 dead 3

[N]Good job Valve, even Marc Laidlaw disapproves your focus on a shitty card game!

[N]I was so disappointed when i saw "Card Game"

[P]nice video of floating rocks, way to get people hyped about your game /s

[N]bullshit

[N]Thank you, Valve, for totally destroying the adventure atmosphere, that used to be in your games! You are raising up the new generation, full of toxic players, cheaters and other sh*tty online gamers. I'm pretty sure that in future everyone will forget about such beautiful games as Portal 2, Half-Life 2, Left for Dead and so on. You've just ruined everything you were working on, you "killed" the previous generation of people, that has been waiting for a new game, full of adventures, full of realistic places, perfect characters, awesome scenario and other beautiful things. I promise, that everyone will forget about you, because you turned the game industry in a machine, that sells sh*t an gets money for that. 

P.S.: I knew some people, who were inspired by Half-Life 2, that game made them feel the life. Before the release they were depressed guys, nobody wanted to talk with, but now they are beautiful guys, who know their aim in this life: make the world better. Do you understand this? A game, a goddamn videogame make them heroes for a while. That's how the games should look like, not this low-qualitied garbage for 11yo players. Nobody more trusts you, Valve, the game is over. Thank you for destroying our hearts. 

Without the respect, 
Russian community

[O]Could you guys atleast update csgo??? VAC, Panorama ui, Source 2, 128 tick servers????

[N]0/10 does not have HL3's engine

[N]It's been 6 years since Portal 2 and God knows how long since Half Life 2. At this point, I've given up. I'd be happy if you were trying new things, but you're not. You're making a digital card game. That thing that I can buy for nothing on the Google Play Store. Seriously Valve, what happened to you? If you continued on the path to victory that you were on 6 years ago, you would be one of the top video game developers in the world. This is a wake up call, Valve. Get it together.

[N]Cancel this game make something people actually want.

[O]Еще один конвеер бабла. Браво, мудаки!

[N]Why can't it be a original card game instead of a dota card game?

[O]So is every game released now going to be microtransaction loaded card game?

[N]WHY VALVE TRY SO HARD TO COPY THE COMPETENCE? WE NEED CS 2.0 ANOTHER VAC OR HALF LIFE 3, NOT THIS SHIT

[N]Fuck you Valve... FUCK YOU!!! 

FUCKING RELEASE THE FUCKING HALF LIFE 3 YOU FUCKING MORON!

[O]Make L4D3 instead.

[N]no. please no

[O]Us: WE WANT HALF LIFE 3! 
Valve: That u want dota cards gaming?
Us: NO,NO PLEASE NO!
Valve: launch Artifact

[O]Valve, if you want my money (we know you do), make a new Half Life or Left 4 Dead. There is nothing else in this world that you can make that I will buy. Not DOTA, not CS:GO, not some silly TF2 hat - NOTHING. I am but one of many who feel this way. Something to consider.

[P]Well played valve.

[O]When you don't need to release big games anymore because you can still make the same amount of money by milking CSGO skins

[O]What if this was secretly going to be Half Life 3?

[P]I’m excited for this game

[N]Its a joke? Please say me if its a joke of Valve.

[O]Guys, guys...we don't have any gameplay footage so this might just be a prank!

[N]Gaben,you failed to me

[P]At least it's not a half life card game right?

[N]Valve caring only about making money, no waaaay. Just change your name already. You aren't Valve anymore. Gaben's ignorance with "gamers don't want another half life" and how you've turned Steam into a steaming pile of turd is proof of this.

[O]RIP Valve

[O]Valve, this is ur priority?

[P]Cant wait for 2025 dota the board game

[N]This shitstorm in comments is the reason why we'll never get HL3. It would be fucking suicide for Valve because the hype is so big that no matter how good would HL3 be it would only get shit on.

[O]Nevermind

[N]Any set up a petition to get it cancelled?

[N]Everyone who lives near valve, I mean come on you all get together to go to conventions. Let's just spend that money to make picket signs and protest outside of valve.

[O]Can anyone explain me why so many dislikes?

[N]This is just so incredibly greedy, they make so much money off of Steam, CSGO & DOTA, but instead of giving us a AAA single player game that we all want, they give us a cheaply made F2P cash grab, even EA isn't this fucking bad, they still make some good single player games from time to time.

[O]RICOCHET TWOOOooo....

[O]niggawatt??

[O]Half-Life 3

[O]Next game is going to be a 2d platformer calling it now

[O]WE WANT HALF-LIFE 3!!!

[O]AWWWWWWW - Valve consumer base.
Giving the people what they want after 6 years. Bravo.

[N]Why even subscribe?

[O]But why

[O]gg volvo

[N]Fuck you valve.

[O]2036 -> The Team Fortress Card game

[P]Still might be a good game though

[N]WHAT , WHAT THE FUCK , BUT YAMI YUGI ? YAMI INVOKER ? YAMI COURRIER ? DUEL LINKS ? DOTA LINKS ?

[N]You could have been working on Half-Life 3 but instead you decide that making a card game is a better decision?

[N]go fuck yourself

[O]So.. Half Life 3 is confirmed then ?

[N]VALVE: So, you like card games?
Gamers: Fck no
VALVE: Too late! Launch Artifact

[N]FUCK THIS SHIT GIVE US HL3

[O]Watch this be really good and get a sequel, but then when we want a 3rd expansion, they just make remastered versions of Half Life, Portal, and L4D

[O]What would Gordon Freeman say...

He would probably be lost for words

[O]34k dislike

[P]Really excited for this. Can't see why there is so much hate.

[N]you are dead to me

[N]fuck you

[O]Valve is basically copying Blizzard's idea and making a card game with characters from a well known IP by them.

[O]Holy shit. This has eleven times more dislikes then likes...

[N]You used to be a trendsetter in the industry, Valve. This is fucking pathetic.

[N]AAAAaaaaAAaaAAAawwwWWWwwwwww WP GG ez Volvo $$$$$$$

[N]fuck you valve

[N]BOOOOOOO!!!

O]I don’t believe that earth is flat. See the Emoji.

[O]If u are in a movin Train and run in the other direction the train is driving you will be as fast at the end of the train as running with the direction of the train is heading. Why because everything is moving so do u, so do the train and the „air“ in the train.  u running in one direction while driving in the other but we don’t notice that. 
And our body/ nature is not able to feel it.

[O]hahaha no it won't

[O]Can I touch you?

[O]We can easily prove that the earth isn't flat by getting in a boat and travelling around it.

[N]No

[O]Reasons why I believe earth is round.
1. Why is there no flat mars society?
2. If earth is flat,then gravity would go crazy!
3. There are so many heavy things in earth,why won't we fall?
4.then why Scientists discovered earths core if the earth is flat?
5. ,then why all the waters on earth are nor falling?if its falling,then the earth will waste water.I said if earth is flat,the gravity would go crazy.

[N]I never seen she's  been so dumb before

[N]Umm... no

[N]the bible says it was flat but not as a pancake, it means it was flat because there were no mountains FLATTARDS

[N]Why do idiots in the 21st century still think the earth is flat? Come on guys-we figured this out centuries ago.

[N]ya know you lost all credibility when you said people who believe in conspiracies tend to feel "excluded, isolated and vulnerable". Nothing about taking time and researching facts

[O]If the Earth is flat why doesn't water fall off the edge?

[O]I wanna post a video of the satellite launch of India's  PSLV today...12 jan 2018
May be America and Russia have enough money to keep funding the controversy of round earth 
Why would a poor nation like india do a mars mission and keep sending satellites to space if it is a flat earth!!...when more than half of its population is starving ??

[N]Flat earthers are the cream of the crop delusional nutjobs! The only thing this video made me believe is this woman has horrible fashion sense... look at her jeans and top???

[O]If the earth was flat there would be no walls

[O]Nobecause the earth's layers DUH

[O]If the earth is flat, surely the sun isn't orbiting the earth

[O]OMG we watched the video about the polar bear in my school today.

[O]if the earth is flat show me a picture of the edge rest my case.

[O]The Earth is flat, eh? Wow! Now let’s all go get drunk and high

[N]Why TF would they lie to us?

[O]to them, we are all like babies.  we listen, and we believe..

[N]Flat Earth society are liars... They are part of the government..

[N]The earth is actually a spheroid dummies.

[P]Nice Mom jeans

[N]earth is not flat but i have a proof that your flat Ms.DoubleBack

[O]If earth is flat then water should be falling off of flat earth

[O]Check out" Beyond the imaginary curve" and "Eric Dubay". They are both youtube channels and are very factual and knowledgable on the Flat Earth subject

[O]ONLY IN AMERICA!

[O]If the Earth were flat, then cats would have already knocked everything off it by now.

[P]LMFAO hilarious

[N]dont talk about this again.... irritate my sense, those flat earthers never learn about gravitation

[O]Join the flat sun society

[O]the flat thing is stupid but i think the moon landing is fake
plz no hate

[O]In a plane you're in the atmosphere and still connected to earth in a way so the earth never moves under you

[N]Because we got the real picture of Earth not flat so are you people who think the Earth is flat you are dumb like Junior from SuperMarioLogan

[O]So................... Earth is the only planet that's flat?

[O]Is the earth is flat then cats would have pushed everything off it

[O]Even with 21st century technology there are two things which science can not detect: 1. Curvature of the earth (especially large bodies of water) and 2. Any motion whatsoever of the earth beneath our feet.  Trust your God-given senses rather than unproven pseudo-science.  The Earth is flat and motionless.

[O]The plane doesn't need to adjust its angle because of GRAVITY

[N]Flat earth is so stupid

[O]Fish eye doesn't make things round. It makes things bulges in the middle and compresses on the edge. Aka opposite of round,

[O]Its in the bible there are hints everywhere

[N]ARE YOU INSANE

[O]Now I know how Trump got elected

[O]if the Earth were flat, we would all experience sunrise and sunset at the same time. Not hours apart. It couldn't be daytime in one part of the world while being night time in another. Across a flat plane, either the sun would be up, or not up.

[O]After hearing all the above points, I want to say one thing only.. RIP Physics.. 😫

[N]Flat eathers need to be shot in the head

[O]they fly straight in planes because gravity exist

[N]I have every answers to your all “because” but let me put it this way why wud nasa russia and isro of india will be hiding this if earth is realy flat? Hmm?? Hmmm? Hmmm? 
Iam shocked so many people believe this

[O]The images are real just with added details to make it look more noticable

[O]1:27 ever heard or this thing called GRAVITY

[O]Is this real?

[O]I believe it cause if the earth rotates 1000 mph how is an airplane able to fly and take Antarctica it has minerals oil you name it but the UN signed a treaty that no one could exploit it and if you try to go there there’s a wall of battle ships

[O]Don't you understand?  The earth does not exist flat or round.  We live in a matrix.

[O]If the earth was flat some parts of countries would be cut off and flat earthers belive in a giant dome  but if that dome existed we cant travel to certain places wich does technally debunk the theory

[O]Get a geography teacher something from the flat earth society. It will spice things up compared to a usual globe(!)

[O]The flat earth= 💩

[N]tell me how will iss orbit earth if its flat earth and why the f*** every planet in the f***ing solar system is round while earth is not 
even Jupiter is round and its much more bigger than earth is round and why you can Travel into one direction and theres no end it will just take you back
the moon landing is not a hoax and this f***ing theory is so dumb that it  didnt even change my mind.
so stop F***ing sending information about hoax.
and gravity exist why do Stop dont fly like what happens in iss! 

[O]the fish eye lens is curving the wrong way

[O]If IT actually is flat and we found out all the space cpmpanys reputation would be ruiner for life

[O]Ok flat earthers don't have answers that apply for their beliefs about the earth, most of their answers about the earth is opposed to the answers we have about the round earth.

If the earth is flat? How does the ice wall not melt?

[O]Well, you don’t know until you see

[O]Not flat

[N]You look out over the Pacific or any ocean and you can't see past a certain point because the Earth is round, it curves.  Crazies.

[N]The earth is round not flat. People who people the earth is flat are idiots. Just saying.

[N]THE EARTH IS NOT FLAT WTF iS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE

[N]No, it won't, because I'm not a complete dumbass.

[N]I know you're being satirical but I wanted to slap you when you went "Hmmm?"

[O]I am here to finally clear this up! The earth is not flat! The earth is not round! It is more shaped like a giant space taco XD

[O]Aristotle conspired with NASA in 350 BC.

[O]If the earth was flat we'd all tip towards America. Due to their weight.

[O]”There are a lot of people that believe in a flat Earth..." There are a lot of people that believe in karma

[O]Still, don't believe in the flat earth theory and my evidence is common sense.

[O]If the earth isn't flat how are we not dead yet

[O]put a physicist in front of a flat earth video and listen to there comments and you will easily see that the earth is round

[N]Our race is failing fast

[O]WHAT ABOUT THE GRAVITATIONAL POLLS? WHAT ABOUT ROTATION? AND SEASONS!!!

[O]1.Lets Assume the plane would fly straight, would it escape the earth? Of course not. Let me explain
Escaping the Earth horizontally would result in going into high altitudes, at which air is rarified, thus reducing the levitating force on the wings. At the end it would be like trying to fly a plane straight up from the ground like a rocket and trying to reach space with it.

[N]Now I belive in Fermi Paradox. All inteligent life have a point of idiocracy. Then it dies out.

[O]I believe we live on something flat

[O]Goodjob

[O]So on the photo it looks like an over sized ice cream cone

[O]FEEF

[N]I actually hate this woman. These can be all proven wrong my gravity.. bUt oViOuSlY GrAvItY DoEs’Nt ExIsT

[N]n a s a fake bullshit.  fake. fake fake.  why do i see only one side of the moon never changes . really ...i beleive god

[O]There is no evidence that earth is flat

[O]I’ll believe in a flat Earth when all the Flat Earthers take a giant leap off the edge.

[O]but then how do you explain volcanos

[N]If you believe the earth is flat you should try drinking bleach. It will open your mind up and you will see the truth in everything.

[O]It's not flat..  Or round...  It is a Donut..   WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!

[O]THE PROOF THAT THE EARTH IS ROUND:Bering straight lol

[N]Dude why do people still believe the earth is flat lmao I laugh at those people

[O]if Earth was flat, would we be able to see continents away from us?
lol

[O]2:12 that earth is not flat, it's still curved

[N]And yes woman you are correct about the plane flying to the east. BUT. You are totally wrong as it is possible to fly to the eaat but that is why we have something called time delay and jetlag between countries. To compensate for this

[O]Me Earthling, me live on Earth, me spend 99% of me life in a 20 Mile radius from my home, me think me know shape of world, me knows about universe,me very smart.  Me get information from people smarter than me, me no think they can lie, IMPOSSIBLE to lie to me! Me know everything! Me never leave 20 Mile radius but me know universe is billions of light years wide, me no explore, me just believe what they tell me.  

Earf flat? IMPOSSIBLE! Smart people show me round ball! Smart people tell truth! No need for me to see, no need to leave me home, me just believe what told to me.

[O]Earth is flat or not.. It doesn't matter... But 100% illuminaties real...

[O]I believe that the earth is round because most of the people that believe in the flat earh theory are usually weed smoking conspiracy theorists with Tin foil hats (who use sodo scientists word or take things that scientists have said and put it out of context.

[O]Brian Cox went 2x speed of sound in an F22 and overtook the speed of Earth's rotation hence reversing the sunset to s sunrise. END OF ARGUMENT.

[N]Dumbass......

[N]The flat earth theory makes me believe that people have become stupid and lack common sense.

[O]So, only earth is flat,(yeah ok) but everything else in the sky is round,(sun, moon , other planets)We so special,lol

[N]Impossible.
As an avid traveller, I have gone on a trip to Portugal, flew to China to visit family, went to Japan, took a flight across the Pacific and ended up back in the U.S.
Never once did we turn around.  
Explain that, Flat-earthers.

[O]REGULAR flat earthers DOES NOT RESORT TO FLAT EARTH SOCIETY!.. THEY LIE.. ANTARCTICA IS THE KEY.. RESEARCH THE ANTARCTICA TREATY!

[O]You've overloaded me with the overexposure of your camera

[N]it's sad that people in the 21st century think earth is flat

[O]I think it's funny how many haters come to vids like this just to spread hatred. They're not interested in flat earth, they just come to hate on the people who are. Smh if somebody choses to believe the earth is flat that's their business! Same as religion, sexual identification, etc... I personally take extreme interest in these. Very entertaining! Good points on both sides, really.

[N]I really wish that earth is flat so that we can take the flat earthers  and throw em off the edge

[O]No because I’ve actually been to space 6 years ago and I’ve seen that it is round

[O]I’d tap

[O]My counter answer is Gravity, Physics, and science!

[O]If the earth was flat why hasn't anyone found the edge of the world then. And we're would the ocean go, it would just run off the edge of the earth. Try explaining that!!

[O]Someone would’ve gone off the edge of earth though

[O]I don't understand arguing about this there are websites where a camera revolves around the earth

[O]The answers behind your questions:
1. The government is NOT out to get you. What would they have to gain? Not to mention you showed no proof with amateur rockets.
2. Planes don't have to fly downward because gravity is not "down". This means that when you are flying in a straight line, the bottom of the plane will be pulled slowly toward the center, angling itself. Gravity is toward the center, which is always changing.
3. Planes having to push against the atmosphere doesn't make sense. When the earth rotates, you move with it, which is why you don't feel movement. The plane is moving relative to the earth. It does push against the atmosphere, but not slower than when traveling west. The atmosphere moves with the earth, you move with the earth. So pushing against the atmosphere wouldn't make you suddenly feel double the force.  

Better explanation:  
ATM(Atmosphere) is moving <----- at 40,000 mph 
You are moving <----- at 40,000
Getting into a plane moving 300 mph -----> against the atmosphere doesn't suddenly feel another 40,000 mph worth of wind force. You are moving 300 mph -----> RELATIVE to the atmosphere, even though it looks like 39,700 <-----.
       
4. The government, yet again, is NOT out to get you.

[O]An idea that first doesn't seem insane.  There's no hope. 
                              -Isaac Newton



JK btw

[N]Wow this video is incredibly retarded and only serves to make its viewers slightly dumber

[O]Those questions were elementary.. but I will answer one question now.. for example, in a passenger airplane, once it reaches a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet autopilot will keep it at that altitude. if you were to fly straight your altitude will gradually increase eventually to the point where the oxygen is so thin that the engine can no longer run and will stall.

[N]All the videos are pointless , logicless and complete zero evidence

[O]I don’t think any of these flat earth believers ever went to school

[O]The earth flat it ain’t a god damn ball

[O]How does this even have over 1000 likes?

[N]Shut up your just another flat earther

[O]1 i'm pretty sure we'd see a lot further out if the earth was flat 2 why isn't the moon flat but only the earth? Also what about other flat planets? Why is the earth only flat? What's keep the water from floating off the edge of the flat world? What's stopping it from floating of?.....sooooo manny questions

[N]Flattards unite and walk off the edge of the earth,

[O]If the Earth was flat, then why do the poles have extended time periods of daylight, and no illumination?

[N]I am in physical pain.

[O]If it’s flat why don’t they find the edge then , huh huh! Lol

[O]The earth isn’t flat

[O]I encourage anyone interested in the subject to continue seeking the best arguments for/against the globe model. 
I have looked seriously into the conversation over the past few years and have concluded the earth is flat and stationary. 
There is nuance to the evidence of our earth being flat. 
Beyond memes and rhetorical questions ending with "huh?....huh?" there are well reasoned arguments and a number of experiments that repeatedly point towards the flat, geocentric model being correct. 
It takes years to consider all this and if you are interested and have the time, it's a great conversation in which to invest.

[O]it didn't

[N]Flat earth society is dis-information. Conspiracy theorist was a term created by the bush administration to make those who had truths about 9/11 etc sound crazy so that explanation at the end about conspiracies is b.s. To all those in the comments asking stupid questions trying doing research first real non biased research. Thanks for bringing it up to people more people should know and test for themselves not just be keyboard warriors.

[O]100+ flat earther were here.

[N]Youre so stupied

[O]NASA is part of the government!

[O]Well if the earth was flat then wouldn't the moon be flat too

[N]I am as big a conspiracy theory guy as anyone..yes there are a lot of things I've seen in these vid that raised my eyebrow...but if you step back and look at some of the things (flat earth) believers say ...you guys are making yourselves look dumb as hell..i mean really?? I can't go along with this one.....so all the other celestial bodies we can see from earth are some projected image...they are round because in the vacuum of space as gravity attracts more material it will build up in a spherical shape..come on I'm a landscaper with no college 44yrs old and I will debate and explode every single theory on flat earth you can think up ...i welcome anyone's response

[O]Charlotte is telling the hardest questions I don't what to SAY!!!!!!!!!!!

[O]you can legit disprove every single one of these theories xD

[N]Flat Earth people is a fool!!!

[O]If the earth was flat we would see space

[N]its 2018 an still no video of a flight around the ball north south only pics in a book from the 80's are you seriously gonna try tell me this doesnt exsist nooo way thats bs such a simple thing to prove once and for all no science just a plane flight and it cant be done a  big LOL to everyone arguing over this whilst this flight and video footage still needs to be filmed i dont want to hear alot of small talk with big words just let people take the flight

[O]Well what would be so damn important about the shape of the earth

[O]If the earth is flat than why does airplane flies round the earth instead of turning back and can you explain the purpose of stars in the sky at night?

[N]No it wont.

[N]Because gravity naturally compresses objects into a spherical form. If a plane is flying forward, gravity keeps it angled. Gravity is the reason for all of this. It is the stupidest thing to think that the earth is flat. Also, astronomy, such as stars that are displaced ect.

[O]Planes fly straight because the atmosphere moves as well

[N]Apparently Earth is flat and the moon and other planets are round. Like dafuq. 

Since other Observable universes exists, I want to be in the one where flat earthers don't exist.

[N]This channel should be called bullshitoverload

[O]LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO nope lol

[O]The earth is a dinosaur

[N]You cant argue with a flat earther... simply not possible. Not unless you are a billionaire who can afford a space ship, to go prove it. Flat earther's are just like religious people, they have FAITH. so... yea. Its dumb to even care about them.

[O]The planes would just fall of if it was flat

[N]I do NOT believe in the Flat Earth theory, because I’m one of those people who’s more intelligent than a shoe.

[O]There should be a show where  flat-earthers have to find the end of the world

[O]If the earth was completely flat, it would be nigh impossible for gravity to exist

[N]I was gonna say something smartass but I lost all my brain cells from watching this. WATCH PROFESSOR STICK HE DEBUNKS THIS LIKE A PRO

[O]1:37 They do have to keep angling it down. It's not hard, just push on the yoke a little.

[O]https://youtu.be/aZC7R8Flg9U

[O]If the plane was facing down I'm pretty sure we'd get pulled into the ground by you know that thing callled gravity....ever heard of it?

[O]The Earth isn’t flat. If you watch a boat go over the horizon, it disappears from the bottom up. I’ve seen this countless times firsthand 

[O]We're still waiting for a picture of the edge

[N]The Earth isn't flat.  All of these questions are awnsered with other questions.  Plus, they are easily & reasonably explainable.  In order to see the curvature of the Earth, you would have to be at an altitude much higher than the flight of a commercial airliner.  If a fish-eye lense were used, then the astronauts, equiptment, & the station would look deformed as well.  In every video of people sending up balloons, you can see curvature.  Planes don't change their stance because of gravity.  Gravity is still pulling on it, the pilots don't have to do anything.  Planes don't have to take a longer trips because the plane is still moving with the planet, still on the planet.  Because of this, either direction would still have trips the same length.  It's just orbiting the Earth at a slightly slower speed.  The last one, there is no scientific explanation because it is a theory.  It makes sence, but it needs some evidence.  Also, please don't do the hmm Hmm thing, my head feels like exploding every single time you do that.

[O]Just because you can't make sense of basic physical laws doesn't mean that they are a lie. It merely proves that you are a little less bright than the average person.

[N]Wow. I still don’t care

[O]The earth is not flat because if it is flat you go in one direction you won't go back around

[N]Flattards unite!

[O]Look I flew a drone before it’s round

[O]Gravity is proof of a round earth because it exerts the same pressure at every point making a sphere the most efficient shape.

[O]This has evolved to a point where I don't know if this is a joke anymore...

[N]Actually crying after seeing some of the comments 

[N]Well if everyone that is a flat ass earth junky is saying its flat its flat then we our selves should be formed differently then how we are now. Not that i wouldn't be cool to be a subspecies of reptile but our hole body structure would in fact be completely opposite of what we are now. Like the wheel would be oh i dont know box not round and you know an asteroid that impacted the earth would of just went right through the pancake disk we are on now.

[O]Mate earth is 3D it ain't flat, gravity pulls earth together and over 1000s of years it smoothes it out into a sphere

[O]How do we go from West Canada to Japan so easily then?

[O]hottie alert and the earth is flat !

[N]mmmmm kay dumbass.... Why do we, aka everyone on the planet literally, see the Sun as a circle if it's flat???????? Why do we see it at all if it's flat, except for a portion?

[N]This is so stupid

[O]I believe in God’s word. Water doesn’t change once it goes over a curve. Up is simply up and downward will never be up.

The devil conspires against God and men of God. This is the conspiracies. This is the building blocks to propaganda. The devil uses men to get God angry. God uses men who seek him (God) out to do his will. Christ says: if you are not doing the will of God then you are doing the will of the devil. There is no side line. Your own free will, will be used in one or the other way. It’s just that simple. Either you serve God or you serve the devil. 

Walking in the valley of darkness. What is darkness? Ignorance or ignoring the word of God as the only truth. You think I’m kidding you. Ha! /.

[O]I’m not a flat earther, however i have been unable to disprove it also. Everything used as proof for the globe simply isn't true. For example, they say ships disappear bottom first over the horizon. That's true, because our eyes have limited perspective, especially at the horizon. You take a zoom lens or telescope, and there is the ship, all of it. You cannot see the earth's curvature from an airplane, which scientists freely admit since you are not high enough. When then obviously you also wouldn't see ships disappear over the horizon. The experiment done to measure the curve of the earth with two sticks 600 miles apart, works exactly the same on the flat earth model. Seasons, everything works just fine with the flat earth model. Lastly, NASA has bubbles in "space", astronauts almost drowning in space, and wires holding them up on the ISS. Just look up images from earth. You will find none that are not composites.

[N]It didn't.

[N]until i see actual proof and evidence, earth isn't flat.
it's not possible.
the theory is retarded.

[N]1:37 well that was complete cringe

Edit: and 1:54

[N]This is stupid

[O]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pcpTjd3BY

[N]This is pretty basic stuff, here, people. Have you ever wondered why you can't see over the horizon? If the Earth were flat, you would be able to see the brightest lights of New York City from California. However, you can't see that far for the same reason a fly can't see the other side of a basketball when they land on it. The horizon is as far as you can see. The proof is that we can't see the opposite side of the Earth, but we can see stars in space millions of light years away. We see the stars because there is no horizon that stops us from seeing it. This is grade school shit, folks. Please put down the bong and slowly back away from the weed.

[N]For all those retards who think earth is flat explain day and night...  Why does night exist?  If world would be flat u should be able to see sun 0/24 right? If don't get what I'm saying than use a telescope 🔭  look at the stars and planets why are those planets not flat huh?  If that's not enough than why the sun has a shape of ball?  If u still think earth is flat common give me your reasons why I'll explain all of them...

[O]It's called gravity

[O]Yes I do and because of the plane thing

[O]If a person actually believes in the Bible, it makes clear that the Earth has pillars that it sets on, that the Earth has waters above which are called the firmament, it  also states the Earth is a circle (but not a globe) just to name a few. Why then would the World Governments want to keep it secret? well, according to the Bible (if you believe in it that is) All the kingdoms of the world at the present moment belong to Satan, he is in control, he is the great deceiver of nations and if man understood this then man will know that there is a God, remember the tower of babel? that means, it actually was about the height and the great rift we see when we look into the heavens is the rift that occurred during the flood of Noah and subsequently sealed back once the flooding had finished.

[O]I have a hi power telescope and have never seen any left behind lunar equipment where NASA says it landed , never , why??? Hmmm,hmmm

[O]Yea it has nothing to do with facts ... people are lonely...    Jesus Christ

[N]hey InformOverload,  your an idiot.....  SPACEX live STARMAN feed debunks all your BS...... LMAO

[O]No.  I do not believe it is flat.  The main reason I don’t believe is because it is dark 60 minutes after it is fully light outside.  Also the darkness pattern is in consistent with a flat earth.  

Other compelling arguments.

I cannot see Cuba from Miami.

I cannot see Topeka from Omaha

Plate tectonics.  If there is an earthquake and the earths plates move, where do they move?

The moon is inverted based on if you’re standing on the northern or Southern Hemisphere. 

I can see Saturn’s rings with a telescope

My friend was a spy plane pilot and he said that he could see the curvature of the earth.
I don’t think that NASA is a bunch of liars.

Light and dark patterns are unable to be predicted with flat earth reliably.  With round earth, it can be predicted Down to the second.

When the us eclipse happened, I saw the international space station in front of the sun.

During a lunar eclipse I can see the shape of the earth.

[N]”And they call me, Punch"

As a matter of opinion any moron who thinks the earth is flat is either just deliberately being a complete attention seeking asshole or if they genuinely believe the earth is flat, then clearly they have a one dimensional brain and should never be allowed to purchase or own a firearm.
"Moral of the Story" Dont allow the mentally ill to own guns (Note: 99.99% of American flat earthers are leftest democrats) And I am certain that is not coincidence, the left thrives on insanity.
Leave the running of the country and science and the space program to Donald Trump and the Republic and they will save the constitution from these left psychopaths.

[O]The whole why isn't it harder to travel East argument doesn't prove flat Earth...it is a logical argument against the Earth SPINNING.

[O]the first time they got out on the moon and took the picture,it was in 1800s and there wasn't photoshop at that time

[O]GO OUT SIDE AMD JUMP THERES YOUR PROOF.

[O]The moon , trade winds...mmmm

[O]If the earth is flat then why do we have time zones? wouldn't he whole world face the sun at the same time making it the exact same time everywhere?

[O]Isnt that rude. Earth-chan isn't flat.
hmmm HMMM

[O]Gravity and aerodynamics

[O]You know, people can say it's a World Government conspiracy, but I don't think Eratosthenes had anything to gain when he calculated the circumference of the Earth more than 2000 years ago.

[N]If you think the earth is round then you are a stupid person.

[O]Read the book "world beyond the poles" it explain the deception of lens, the world is flat and infinite, wake up!

[O]Gravity has never been proven. 
The Bible says sun moon and stars were made for days after the Earth

[N]So this chick thinks that people who think the earth is flat are loners and weak? Lol wow!!!

[O]Many people believe in the The Flat Earth Theory. However, what goes THROUGH their minds thinking the earth is flat? 
Typo, professor.
Just saying.
By the way big speller, are you 100% sure the earth is round?
Have you got personal scientific proof?
I thought so.

[N]You said that cos you're jelouzxz that ur t*ddies are flat.. BOOM

[O]The plane flies straight because of ATMOSPHERE

[O]Wow I'm early......

[O]Every planet in space is round accept Earth? lol

[N]Because the atmosphere moves wirh the earth... it's not that hard

[N]I, I, I... I couldn't even make it to the two minute mark. My brain doesn't allow my IQ to drop that low

[O]I don’t believe in the flat earth theory and never will like if u agree

[N]It's okay, virgin are gonna be doing flights to space soon so flat earthers can see for themselves 

[O]"What goes thought their minds thinking..." ? Do tell. What goes thought their minds?

[O]The united nations logo is the flat earth map.  Explain that one.

[O]I can't remember the guys name but, he proved the earth is round from him seeing a boat in the far distance, slowly go down into the horizon, which he knew that the earth had a round shape.

[O]My answer to the plane theory: ever heard of gravity? Well that’s how gravity works, you stay level as you’re going around because earth has even gravity everywhere. And question: how did Pearl Harbor happen? Because Japan didn’t fly over Asia and Europe and the rest of the entire US to get to Pearl Harbor

[N]Pure idiocy, the Earth is not flat period!! Aircraft do not have to angle downward be cause they maintain a constant distance from the surface, and yes flying into a head wind does slow you down, BTW the Atmosphere rotates with the plant due to Gravity winds are caused by pressure differences in the atmosphere with air moving from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. Can any flat Earther explain how I can maintain a constant heading on a flight around the world and wind up back where I started?

[N]I'll call all this "science" BULLSHITOLOGY

[O]Think outside the 

[O]"Why do these people believe in the flat Earth? They must have some sort of psychological problem which is indicative of the way our society is."

Or people believe in the flat Earth for the simple reason that there is not one shred of evidence we can collect ourselves that shows the Earth is spherical.  I know, it's absolutely crazy to suggest that the government has the capabilities and resources to fake a couple of pictures and videos.  World governments have such a good track record, there's no way they could lie to us, right?

I like to look at the flat Earth as a mindset rather than a model of the world... QUESTION EVERYTHING.  Jokes aside, I don't mean everything everything, just the data that we can not verify for ourselves.  I'm  not saying question whether or not China exists because you've never been there, I'm taking about questioning the data they collect from hundreds of light years away or the photos of our Earth that only like 30 people have supposedly seen from space. 

It's frustrating that flat Earth is looked at in such a negative light.  We're called stupid and yet when we ask people how they know the Earth is round we receive the same blanket term responses over and over...  GRAVITY!!! SCIENCE!!NASA!!!! THE MOON!!! THE STARS!!! DIDNT YOU GO TO SCHOOL MAN!?!?!?

I've got a $1000 reward for anyone who can prove by themselves that the Earth is a sphere, I'm still waiting.

[O]Why the hell would the government do that for anything.

[O]You see, the gravity would just pull the earth into a ball anyways. Vsauce has a video up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqNnUJVcVs&t=393s

This explains everything. ALSO.
If the earth is flat, why does the sun go down?

[O]The earth is not flat. There are a lot of things that the flat earth model cannot explain some of them are the rotation of the stars around the celestial north and south pole, the position of the sun on different locations on the equinox at local noon, seasons or even something simple as a sunset.
The heliocentric model of the earth can explain these phenomena.
We have many pictures of the earth showing a spherical shape. But even without these pictures we can determine it is a sphere.

[O]Sarcasm is the worst flat earth response. The theory involves much more than simply a flat earth. On the whole it says the earth is much unlike we are being told. The globe could be much larger than they are telling us simply because they don't want anybody leaving and starting their own society. You know they would. That is why it might appear so flat. This is exactly what they are doing with Antarctica right now. You cannot go there. There was an article in the papers today stating that the gov't is starting to admit a lot about what went on at area 51. Don't discount any theories, you might get the disclosure you didn't want to hear. There are only two possibilities: we are alone, or we are not. They are both scary possibilities.

[N]fish eye lens? yes, that's the most scientific explanaiton!

[N]i feel sorry for this young lady sounds stupid for 3 min

[O]Why did she mention pancakes when I'm hungry for breakfast food?

[N]Propaganda video

[N]All of you are stupid how the hell garvity doesn’t exist stupid reply to me you stupid flat earthers the earth is a sphere

[N]It is flat i knew since they told me in sixth grade it was round the plans fly not hover

[O]I don’t get why they  just don’t take one of these ppl who believe the earth is flat into space

[N]Omfg this is just a waste of time....

[N]What do governments and NASA have to gain by lying about the shape of the earth? The oil theory doesn’t hold up considering how energy efficient conscious we have become.

[O]Earth is an oblate sphereoid...

[N]Planes don't have to angle downwards because of cough gravity cough

[O]The plane part got me very confused and almost a stroke

[N]So Stupid

[N]That last statement is bullshit statement created by narrow minded people of power trying to control others thoughts and make open minded beings like ME sound dumb or crazy. I AM OPEN MINDED

[N]Mmm still don't believe any of this carnage 

[O]I-IM NOT FLAT!!!!!!!

[O]Take the T from the word planet it spells Plane look in the dictionary and the word plane means completely flat

[O]If the earth is flat then someone please tell me why the he'll our planet has gravity

[N]dumb

[O]0:00 well earth isn't flat in the picture

[O]I am still looking for evidence that the world is round anyone. Tell me about your most compelling evidence now shoot...

[N]its flat because xxtentacion is dying and become less revelant 

[O]Well earth can't be perfectly round nor flat so wouldn't it be oval

[O]sunset and destroyed all the theories of flat earth

[N]You must have autism to thing that

[O]When you dig down in games you fall in space

[O]If the earth is flat, then a hundred million people have somehow been convinced to stay quiet.

[N]CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! YOU JUST LOST A DOZENS OF BRAINCELLS!!!!!!!

[N]The world is only FLAT, where I am standing. Flatards cant give the diameter of the earth. and they believe the sun is smaller than the earth. And come to find out people in other countries don't believe in the flat earth; Only in America people can concoct silly notions and pass them on to the masses.

[N]This can't possibly be what the flat earth society believes...

The "plane angling" thing could be explained by gravity. A centripetal force changes the angle of the velocity of an object.
The travel time is because the plane actually takes off from the earth, meaning it's in rest relative to the earth and the air layers it's flying through.

If anything, this makes me doubt the education system these people were exposed to.

[N]All you people that think flat earth is real are absolutely and truly chewed. I didnt go school and even i know this flat out shit is 100% wrong

[N]They feel excluded, isolated and vonerable because they have no knowledge. Usually they also believe the earth is flat because of the Bible. Passages written prior to the intention of the telescope. They became fools when living in the information age, they don't do anything.

[N]You people have all lost your minds

[O]So I can walk to the edge and jump to space

[O]The horizon always rises to the eye... Only proof needed

[O]I have more of a plausible theory. I think the earth is actually a floating block of cheese that is held together by glue from our alien overlords. Who agrees with me?

[O]1:17 the reason AMATEUR rockets don't 'show' the curvature is because they are too low to be able to see it with the naked eye.

[O]Can you Twerk for my potato

[O]Not a single flat earther can explain how tides work.

"Round earthers" figured it out thousands of years ago...

[N]Flat Earth is a silly stupid fad.

[O]Ginger head woman - Can you please provide me with the most compelling evidence that the earth is round?

[N]If you going to push fake conspiracy theories to smear real ones, at least have the wit to not to announce who is behind them within the first 15 seconds

[N]It is very interesting  that all these flat earthers are probably below average in math and science yet they have mastered this (by looking at a couple dorky Websites). There is no math; it does not work. Navigation as we know it works, but not on a flat earth! THAT is overwhelming proof. let's get the flat earthers a huge boat and let them navigate - bye bye dummies!

[N]If the earth was really flat we would have no atmosphere no life and earth would spin twice as fast I don't see the logic also the lens thing is just bs of course if you put a different lens in your camera your pic is gone look different ffs have some logic and make some sense first

[O]hmmmm?? hmmmm?? CUTE.. lol! 

[N]No

[O]Intelligent flat earth explanations from a flat earther :  evidence / your eyeballs curve the horizon, you can test this out. If you go to a big body of water, and you look out on the water straight, you'll notice wherever your eyes are focussing, it's the highest spot in the water, it's because of the concave on your eyeball, everything to the side of where you're focussing goes downwards because of the curve of the eyeball. Fisheye lens work the same way On go- pro cameras, but there curved even more so you really notice the earth curving. People aren't taught this. that's why you see curve when you go up in an airplane, because once you pass 20,000 feet your eyeball rounds out the earth. And so do go pro cameras. Now On normal Camera without a fisheye lens, it is going to show the true form of the earth because it's not bending anything, it's a flat lens, not concaved like your eyeball. That's why the horizon is flat no matter how high you go with a normal lens camera. Most people aren't taught this about the way their eyeballs, and perspective work,  how everything goes into the horizon line, and disappears. Test it out for yourself, look down a long road that is straight and flat, and everything above your eye level will go downwards the further away it gets, and everything below your eye level Will go upwards into that horizon line and disappear. This is Why Street Poles get smaller as They get further away, and the road goes upwards until it hits your eye level and disappears this is how the boats disappear this is how the sun disappears, it's also how the bottoms of buildings start to disappear with the water line. the further away you are, it's because the water in front of the buildings starts going upwards into the horizon line. No curve at all.  It's all perspective, and a bit of an allusion if you're not taught about it

[N]I will believe your flat earth theory when I see proof of the EDGES of earth, not just an artists rendering of what it would look like. Surely this would be simple to do. I would think one of you flat earth believers would fly a plane to the edge and post the photo's all over the internet. Why has this not been done to prove yourself? Am I just supposed to believe what you say? Is the flat earth square, round, rectangle, or a triangle?

Alien life has more proof than your ridiculous opinions.

[O]how can an air plane travel west and get to china then. you didnt think that throgh

[O]It say it in the biber

[O]EARF I FLATT

[N]OMG THE EARTH IS NOT FLAT HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS , lmao this girl really thinks our earth is flat this b$!#$ needs to go bake to 3 grade

[N]and by then lying to us about us NOT being the center of the universe, they take God out of the equation and say that were a fluke

[N]A lot of these “debunkers” are Zionist paid trolls. Tell me why they look Jewish and or have Jewish names backgrounds and or looks. Search it. Dobre btw has Romanian/polish roots, get it?

[O]Getting to America to Russia the plane fly's left and the actual direction is right also the earth rotates slowly so yeah the earth isn't flat

[O]Beware of the irony in this question. Where is the flat potato society

[O]Not even a 72 hour video with “evidence” would convince me that the earth is flat.

[O]what about the boats which circumnavigate the globe?

[O]Why is it dark in China when I call my friend mid sunny day in Cali?? Hmmm?! Hmmmm?!!

[N]This is fucking stupid

[N]Woah woah woah... slow your roll. If you think the EARTH is flat you gotta FLAT mind.

[N]When conservatives see the flat earth theory, the dismiss it as crazy talk and move on.
When liberals see the flat earth theory, they try to conflate it with all things, ideas, religions and people they don't like.

[N]I believe the world is flat because I want it to be as I'm a victim who got bullied a bit spoilt and feel the world owes me.

[O]SUPPORT MAD MIKE HUGHES STEAM POWERED ROCKET ! www.madmikeflatearth.com

[O]http://www.antarcticaflights.com.au/ fly to antartica today and prove your theory!!

[O]Can someone explain to me what the government has to gain from lying about the shape of the earth? So far no one has even attempted to give me a reason.

[N]My evidence for the flat earth: people are idiots

[O]Earth chan is not flat

[N]Flat earth is bs. It is hollow, look it up.

[O]Airline pilots and passengers can attest to longer flight times when traveling west... it took me 4 1/2 hours to fly from atlanta to Longbeach but only 3 3/4 hours to fly long beach to atlanta this is because of the rotation of the earth .. it wouldnt take  twice the time as Flat earthers believe because as you travel west the earth continues to rotate to the east so even tho it does take more time to travel west by air  it does not take twice as long

[O]It's NOT flat. One reason is because if it was. Then there would be giant waterfalls falling off of the edge. The atmosphere won't keep water contained. There would be water falling off the edges.



And then this is how the solar system would work. 

B= Ball or round
F= flat


Sun: B
Moon:B
Mercury: B
Venus:B 
Earth:F 
Mars:B 
Jupiter: B
Saturn: B
Uranus:B
Neptune:B 



So the earth is a disc but the entire rest of the solar system is not? See that makes no sense

[N]They also think that the Sun is 3000 miles away from us lol

[N]Flat earthers are just ignorant skeptics. Just because you either choose to ignore or simply don't understand the science behind gravity, atmospheres and the constitutional make up of space, doesn't mean the earth is a pancake.

[O]If the earth is flat I can say the sun is a potato lit on fire

[O]The earth is accelerating up at 9.8 m/s/s. Gravity is a lie.

[O]narf narf "erth es plat" narf narf

[N]I believe governments are all lying, but why I believe the earth is round is because nobody has reached the end of the earth where you fall off... Where is the iPhone picture from the side of the earth? Nobody has taken pictures of it yet? Yeah... they are the same people who believe we haven't gone to the moon.

[O]my doctor told me not to masterbate but don't know after see you i feel like to do

[O]I'm not convinced, esp when I can see curvature moving away from me on ANY large body of water with my own eyes.

[N]The reason why the earth spinning one is stupid is because it’s spins once every 24 hours. It spins VERRRRRYYYY slowly, so flying east isn’t that hard

[O]Charlotte I've been a potato forever dang it love what you do now gimme a shout out

[N]How stupid can someone be? The answer is right here! Really, is this a joke?

[O]I'm flat earther 

[O]When on holiday on the Isle of Skye I climbed 700 metres up to the top of the Store Mountain, took a photo of the ocean and surrounding land mass and when I looked at the photo guess what? A massive curvature! The flat road I had driven on to get to the Storr wasn't flat at all it was curving round. Could it be the further north you go in the world the more the curvature is noticeable? If the earth was indeed flat then that photo wouldn't have turned out the same way.

[O]Thay said that planes would have to be directed downwards ther is a gravitational pool and it keeps the plane going straight to matter What way the earth is spinning

[O]Earth is flat. Water is alwaysflat and don't bend over a curve. Common sense

[N]1. Why would they fake the earths roundness that’s right they wouldn’t 
2. The truth is that the plane does have to tilt abit to conpensate the curve but gravity does most of the work. That is also why a plane never goes full straight.
3. No it wouldn’t be harder, if you are on a train that is going 150km/h, do you find any difficulty going to the back of the train. No you wouldn’t it would be the same as going to the front. Same logic applies to the earth.
4. If it was flat then it would due to it’s own gravity collapse into a ball.
Anything else u want me to debunk?

[O]IF THE WORLD IS FLAYE WHY HAVE NO KNE FELL OFF YET?

[N]ugh, can we just tell the flat earth's to go to the edge of the earth, take a picture of dropping something off of it and show us, and then take us there so we can kick them off of it, try flat earthers, TRY

[O]I’d like to make breakfast for her, maybe pancakes 

[O]Your moving with the earth!

[O]I went to China and Russia, then I went to Europe and Africa. I came back to South America and came back up through Mexico and North America. I’ve been to Alaska and Canada while serving for the U.S. Navy. Please explain how I was able to make all of those trips and come back to my very home in the United States all while heading towards West. If the earth was flat, wouldn’t I have fallen off or Ran into some ice wall? These flat earth or’s or people that clearly have mental disabilities and clearly do not get out much at all.

[O] u can answer these questions by simply looking up lol

[O]Still done believe

[O]Space ship hoes straight up and goes left or right so it means there like invis wall after flat earth

[N]What a joke am I right

[P]Hi, awesome video :) Where do you get the images you use in your videos from? I want to make similar video, but I want royal free images to use - is Pixabay a safe option? Thanks.

[N]no because that would be gay

[N]This is so dumb. The atmosphere spins with the earth.

[N]Just look at that like to dislike ratio. Even for someone like me, who thinks that most people are stupid, I can honestly say that I'm glad with at least being proven wrong a little bit, that at least most people aren't stupid enough to believe garbage like this...

[O]I'm a Conspiracy Theorist, but I don't believe the earth is flat, I need evidence

[N]I want my 3mins back pls, what a load a crap.....People will do anything to feel special OMG

[O]Hi, I believe in a flat earth and my name is Bruce Willis....

[O]If earth IS flat, does that mean the other planets are as well? 

[O]Our earth is not flat..

[N]If people are feeling excluded that's they're own damn fault. We are all on this planet together. Of course people are going to turn other people into victims haha stupid. Example- South Africa blew up Libya. Well that's cause they were feeling bad cause they didn't win a gold metal at the Olympics. Any of us would blow up another country if we lost. Haha what! There is no excuse we all have feelings. You can't act on those feelings. We all deal with our feelings in different ways. If you act badly cause of them there is no excuse cause people all around the world have bad feelings that they want to act on but don't cause they know it's the wrong thing and it's primitive. You can't make up excuses for people who act badly cause it tells them that they can keep doing bad things. I've gotten off topic but fuk it haha

[N]You just told me the only reason I and other people believe the earth isn't round is because we're alone and feel vulnerable and left out, to the rest of the world LMAO that's really low I don't think phycology is the blame for the lack of curvature.

[N]HAHAH THE EARTH IS NOT FLAT

[N]You're more stupid than a potato

[N]Reads Description "many people believe"
Ok stop right there

[O]Just maybe its flat and round.......

[O]If gravity is not real, how come objects that we throw upwards fall downwards onto the ground?

[O]what if... now bare with me on this... what if...




NASA was telling the truth and the earth is round!?

[O]1:37

[N]Space is a figment of man's imagination. We live under a dome. No one has ever left. The earth is a motionless plane. If the earth was a ball, spinning at 1000 mph at the equator, and we know the further we get from the equator the speed at which we are traveling would decrease. If "gravity" which is keeping us from flying off and remains constant regardless of position on earth. then depending on your position on earth, you would be at your lightest on the equator but the further you moved north or south, since the force of the spin trying to fling you off would also decrease, you would become more and more heavy. Thus we know, there is know gravity and we are certainly not on a spinning ball. I'm not a mathematician, but I think this is simple physics. Oh, if you believe the globe, stop referring to it as round. Flat planes are round too. 

[N]If you wanted to make me even slightly consider it I would need a multiple hour long video with REAL proof that hasn't been debunked

[N]Anyone who says the earth is flat is either a liar or completely stupid. People have known that the earth is round for hundreds and hundreds of years, and the new advancements in technology in the last century have only made proving that the earth is round easier. If the earth is flat, then how did Magellan and his crew circumnavigate the earth in the early 1500’s? And for what exact reason would scientists have to lie to everyone about something that everyone on the planet should know? The people who have convinced themselves and anyone dumb enough to believe anyone with a loud enough voice that the earth is flat should simply let themselves die. Because these people are nothing more than gullible conspiracy theorists who are unable to accept and see beyond anything that they cannot see with their own two eyes. It is people like them who are not only trying to plague the minds of even more gullible individuals, but trying to hold back the advancement of the mankind and bring us back to the dark ages, simply because they think they are being rebellious and individualistic for not believing in something that they know deep down is true. Perhaps some of these people will see the error of their ways and believe in something that everyone on earth should accept by now, but for those who still stubbornly hold on to this misguided belief, I feel incredibly sorry for you and for humanity.

[N]This channel is a joke

[O]If the earth was flat then why don’t we all see the moon?Where does the sun and moon go when they switch?How do we have sunsets and sunrises?

[N]Well , this video just Flat-Earthed me.   Bad one .....okay.

[O]have you seen the edge of earth?

[O]So, do the same for 911. I want to know what you think went on that day. Were planes really used? What brought down building 7? Building 6 hole blown through the center? No plane found in PA?

[N]Well, there are lots of planets which look round, so what is your problem to believe that earth is also round? Stupid!
at 1:03 Why would they lie to you about the earth in the first place? will you do something horrible to them if you find the earth is flat? 
at 1:15 drones can't click earth's real shape. cause it doesn't fly that higher to notice it. 
at 1:27 it is because of the same reason, it is not high enough. 
at 1: 42 You should read more about Einstein's theory of relativity.when a plane takes off, it was actually moving with the Earth's spin. Which mean it really doesn't make much sense. well tell me one thing, if you are standing in a bus, is it harder to jump forward then jumping backward inside the bus? 
2:15 Haha this is a quite nice reason to prove your stupid point, There are lots of other countries and governments and scientists who do research about the planet, do you really think they can't figure it out?

[N]How many times do we have to go through this.... IT'S NOT FLAT

[N]no

[O]this is how much me and my family research

[O]One word that disproves these theories: Gravity

[N]I wonder if her parents are disappointed

[N]im just shocked looking through these comments and seeing that there are complete idiots here who believe the earth is flat.

[N]The Flat Earth is super dumb

[O]1:29 GRAVITY

[O]But i thought the earth was a potato!!!!!

[N]Ye Stupid arse bitch

[O]1:24 INHALES BOI

[O]Ok if the earth is flat (which is isn't), wouldn't it be daytime everywhere on earth 24/7? And what about the axis? Would earth tilt?

[O]If the Earth is flat how did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor?

[N]Flat earth is a hoax

[P]I believe in the flat earth and am now a fully fledged senior member. Tickets for our conferences are only up to $250 each, so grab yourself a ticket, t-shirt and $500 miniature golden flat earth 'globe' model for your home whilst you still can. It's a steal. If you can't make it you could always heavily donate or look out for one our upcoming endless series of books, dvds, blurays or drm-for-free documentaries.

[N]Well shit now what? I was looking forward to space travel but now im stuck on a flat earth how boring

[O]No matter how advance humanity develops, there will always be a group preaching their eccentric beliefs, from religion to aliens and now the flat earth belief... To this day, none of them have hard evidence to confirm it's existence and because it hasn't been proven it encourages people to purely just 'believe in it'. The members in these communities are all looking for answers, freedom, improvement or healing and when a service creates an illusion for hope, the community will expands resulting to more funding. A good example is the pharmaceutical and medical industry. There's always someone on the top who is laughing and cashing in!

[N]I don't believe the earth is flat because my boyfriend lives in Australia. Everything is backwards for him, the moon is upside down (though it "flips" do to the angle once its on the other side of the sky), the seasons are backwards for him, its day for him when its night for me, and he can see constellations i cant. The milkyway looks different where he is too, and he can also see the Small Magellanic Clouds, something that i, me being in the northern hemisphere, cannot.

The difference in the hemispheres are proof enough for me the earth is not flat.

So I'll never believe the earth is flat unless i was taken up in a rocket and looked down didn't see what I expected.

But thats not going to happen. One day i will if musk gets his way, i will experience space, i will look down at earth and see the gorgeous marble people like you neglect.

[N]Nope

[N]people play around with the word "theory", in the scientific sense, theory means well-confirmed with ALOT of proof behind it

[N]No

[O]just look up at the sky you can see the sky in a sphere shape

[O]MY PUPPY IS PART OF POTATO FAMILY.  I think she is vegan.

[N]Stop showing a flat rock in space!!!! That is a complete wrong model. God damn it. No flat weather believes it’s a floating flat rock in space ..

[N]but... if it was flat, where is the end of earth? wouldn’t we just fall off? people these days...

[O]Oh my god guys...the sun is flat to

[N]Omg these all have simple answers

[N]The earth is round and my reason Is people are really stupid.

[O]Earth isn't flat.
It's oblete steroid

[N]provided zero evidence of a globe earth.

[N]God this is so wrong!  all the “explanations” are just so dumb!!! Airplanes don’t keep “angling” because gravity works on a right angle every time and they also don’t go faster when going East because there’s something called Atmosphere in which they fly in! And this so called atmosphere travels with the Earth. Ever guessed why the earth doesn’t move below you every time you jump?? Idiot... Please go home, or to school to learn something for a change!

[N]The main reason to cover up... Our creator. Trying to kill God in our minds.
Or NASA went up there, noticed OH, OH! Nothing to see here.
Came back and lied, lied, and kept lying while still cashing billions of tax payers money. Main motive... Billions.

[O]the reason I don't believe the earth is flat... neither is my head.   all joking aside it isn't easier or harder because the atmosphere does not move in a uniform pattern globally.  it goes up and down.  not to mention that there is a jet stream which would be impossible to maintain if the earth was flat.

[O]And how can the Earth be flat. If the center of mass is in the middel the Earth wil crumble in to a ball

[N]Hazarding a guess.. but to try and answer the question referring to planes not having to angle down in order to travel around the globe, isn’t that gravity? I’m pretty sure it’s acts almost like a loop in a roller coaster, the gravity kind of acts like a centrifugal force which draws anything in within its reach aka our atmosphere, no? And as for images of our horizon being manipulated by NASA.. what a load of bollocks, I’ve been to Africa and seen the curvature of our earth on the horizon. I think you have to be either really stupid or bordering insane to believe this.. Finally, why would anybody lie about this? What/who benefits from this? 

To any flat earthers getting a sweat on reading this, try and convince me with facts and evidence, not spiritual belief or faith. Try do it in a non offensive way too as I’ve noticed you guys do get pretty insulting when you can’t formulate a decent argument. 

Much love, a logical human. Xx

[P]Earth ain't flat who ever thinks the earth is flat then they are really dumb Jesus

[O]The earth isn't flat. It's a pyramid

[P]She's fine as hell but damn is she dumb

[O]they have to photo shop pictures of the earth they wouldn't be able to get a good looking panorama of the whole thing

[P]Flat Earth Society is fake. I believe in flat earth Via emperical evidence: no curve i.e. we see stuff across the ocean that should be hidden.

[P]A “theory” is a coherent and rational explanation for a body of data. As there are no real data supporting the idea that the Earth is flat, and overwhelming, crushing, mountainous, clear, and irrefutable evidence that the Earth is round (some of which this writer has seen with his own eyes), there is no theory that states that the Earth is flat. There is no such theory in the same way that there is no theory that the psychotic at the state mental hospital...

[O]All Heavenly Bodies pull themselves into a sphere due to gravity that's why when you look at the Sun or the moon you can tell they are a ball not a flat disk

[O]In every flight ive been on it takes longer to fly east than west.

[O]Well first off you can fly a plane around the earth without stopping and without falling off any edges  if the earth was flat we wouldn't have the existence of time zones and why does the earth cast an oval shadow in each and every lunar eclipse? So The Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune etc. Are all spherical in shape but the earth is a flying pancake...ok.

[O]Then why do we have horizons? Also, I think God would prefer it round. Also because we see other planets that are round why would ours be flat?

[O]Flat earth stops!

[O]Why can’t I see China when I look through my telescope in USA? Simple because the earth is not flat

[P]your so wrong about the whole conspiracy theory making people feel powerful and get control ??? your so wrong little girl !! .. tell me why you can see light houses from over 40 miles out at sea? that light house should be under 100 feet of water .. why does the moon seem to be ROTATING around us ?? take a photo of the moon when it rises and take one when it sets .. if the moon was going around us, then the moon should never be rotating like a clock ... what about the woman who gave birth in Alaska, the plane was going to LA from Bali but stopped for an emergency landing in Alaska  ??? Hawaii is closer but i guess the air lines didn't want to charge the people???????????   so instead of landing on an island that's on the way to LA you take a detour to Alaska ????  if you film the sun rising and setting, you will notice the sun getting bigger as it gets closer to you, and gets smaller as it sets .. the earth is flat ....  if they went to the moon who the hell was filming as they were landing  !?!!!!!!!?????? 3 guys went to the moon ?? one stayed behind as it slung shoot around the moon they say .. and the other 2 were on the lunar lander ..  SO WHO WAS FILMING THE LANDING ?? and how in the hell did they get that lunar car on that small ass lunar lander,? that was big enough for 2 people !!!!????

[O]The plane thing is easy have you heard of gravity

[O]Well the world was made round, the Maps we are looking at are all wrong , you cant transform a cylinder ball un flat

[O]Why aren’t there any photos of Polaris from Australia? If the reason you can’t see Polaris is simply because of perspective, anyone in the Southern Hemisphere below 1 degree of latitude should be able to point a telescope in the direction of Polaris, and see it. 

I’ve been searching the internet, and I can’t find 1 single photo. I feel like this would be a slam dunk for the flat earth movement.

This is an experiment ANYONE can do, yet it isn’t done.

Where did I go wrong?

[O]is it just flat earth proof and me that are flat earthers here because when i go down the chat thats really everything i can see. everyone els has no idea ABOUT WHAT US FLAT EARTHERS BELIEVE.

[N]With information fake facts

[O]Earth doesnt spin that fast..

[O]The very first thing you NEED to know is that "the flat earth society" only exists to make flat earthers sound uneducated. The most compelling evidence that we've been lied to about alot is that the temperature of the moon can be tested by anyone and the moon is giving off a cold light, the complete opposite of the sun.

[O]Have you ever seen a map?.. FLAT!

[O]The test would be predictive power. 

Science explains and PREDICTS things like tides, solar and lunar eclipses, the next approach of Halley's comet. 

What does flat Earth theory predict?  I will make a calendar note.

[O]If the earth is flat, why does it make a round shadow on the moon during an eclipse? HM? HMM? HMMM?

[O]My dad has been in space the world is not flat

[O]This is information overload....  

Where is the actual information?

[O]Charlotte I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU

[O]The Earth is not flat that was in first grade 101 cuz basically if the Earth was flat there be no gravity those pictures are real Batman show did you can disagree on me but the Earth is not flat on a why you think that but it's not because if you want to go up into space and see it for yourself so you can actually see the perfect flat but if you send something up there you can believe me the Earth was not flat

[N]you guys are so retarded the word is obviously a cube

[N]This isn’t serious right. This is satirical

[N]If you believe in flat earth, you're not that smart.

[O]There is no possible way that the earth could be flat

[O]Earth is round period

[O]2 easy reasons that anyone can use to easily disprove are the moon, and time zones.

[O]I don't know earth is flat or round but I am flat on this girl.. look awosem beautiful..

[N]Hmm hmm we still have stupid like you hmm hmm, pathetic.

[O]So You're saying that a 3 min video will convince me that gravity dosent exist.

[O]Early

[O]DENSITY

[N]No

[O]I dont believe in either yet i need to do my research. not from what i here.

[N]I never will believe this

[O]We need to get these people a ride to outer space

[O]All of these checked accounts that have an opinion on the flat earth theory are either discrediting free thought or have something to gain...

[N]Slaps Face WTF are you saying that is too ... nonsense really going to destroy the truth of the unexplainable Creation if you think the airplane moves straight then gravity is fake and Please Explain the arc shape in the seas of the Philippines you can see there in sundown that the earth is round definitely round and if you travel from Phillipines to US wouldn't it be faster to travel in the Pacific Ocean? and One more thing If the Earth is flat there would be invisble walls and if we travel by boat we would fall into the void

[O]I don't get it

[O]The Earth is flat Guys!
We just have to increase our render distance so we can see the ice walls

[O]I believe In a round Earth. I will never believe In A flat earth.

[O]All FE should 

[O]There is no evidence it is not flat

[N]WHAT EVEN CAUSED YOU GUYS TO THINK THE EARTH IS FLAT?! Why would someone make it up that it’s round. HAVE YOU SEEN THE EARTH EDGE? HAVE GOU FALLEN OFF THE SIDE?! You are crazy if you actually believe this stuff. What caused you to think this? There is no proof. Your mind has gone back centuries for some weird reason. How could all the people who have gone to space be convinced to keep this secret. Huh?! It makes NO SENSE. I’m losing brain cells just thinking about this. If you think this then honestly just go to space yourself you’ll see it’s round and maybe gain back some of your lost brain cells.

[O]1:02 why do you think this
1:26 gravity 
1:44 you are moving with the earth. the atmosphere counts as it.

[O]Flat earth?
So ISS rotates roughly 4.76 miles per second (17,150 mph) so how is it that in, rotating on the earth axis  (rotating nearly 1,000mph) not have gravity in it? It's rotating on earth's axis, but faster. And and I emphasize And no rotational gravity.  So if theirs a spherical object (such as a ring (halo)) it in theory it CANNOT have centrifical force in space(or artificial gravity)?, because if ISS does NOT have artificial gravity then it doesn't exist.

[N]Why does our government hide this info?   






Answer: they don’t it’s all bs

[O]If the earth was a pancake then it wouldn't orbit the sun the same way all over planters do, also if the earth is flat why aren't mars-Venus-Uranus (my personal favorite)-Pluto and si on not flat as well? And if the earth is flat then how could there be a six hour time delay between America and England?

[O]Point 1: GRAVITY is why planes don't have to angle down. The downward force of gravity keeps the plane is rotation with the earth at the same speed. This is why we don't feel the earth spinning.
Point 2: Photos of Earth that are trying to prove that Earth is flat can also be photoshopped.
Point 3: The moon landings were REAL. Consult anyone about this. 
Point 4: These people need to rejoin society and people should accept them. (Maybe not these types of ideas)

[N]Honestly who tf cares like it doesn’t make a difference in how you live or anything people need to move on.

[O]so yeah

[O]The Earth is round......what has the world come to?

[N]you believe in the earth, idiots

[O]Then where does lava from volcanoes come from?

[O]Not flat

[O]If you payed attention in space and earth science classes, you would be able to debunk all of this.

[O]I think the world is round no matter what but

[N]I have been outside. I dont need nasa to tell me the earth is round

[O]My favorite piece of evidence is, all the evidence that proves flat Earth is wrong

[O]Belief ..  in a theory?

[O]ok whats the edge? explain what happens...

[O]um ok XDD why would they lie about it in the first place like what would be the benifit

[O]If earth is flat we only would stand straight in the center

[N]Sure, every celestial body is round, but Earth is flying through the space like a damn frisbee.

[O]The sea is level. The sea covers about 70% of the world. Therefore the world is at least 70% level.

[O]Duh. The horizon has always been HORIZONtal.

[O]The earth is flat

[P]I love u Charlotte

[O]“According to researchers, people are more likely to believe conspiracy theories when they are feeling excluded, isolated and vulnerable”
That’s it in a nutshell and IMO also accounts for Trump and Brexit both of whose campaigns fostered notions of their opponents being part of some amorphous conspiracy.

[N]the most stupid video I've ever watched. ever

[O]How to prove the earth is not flat
1. watch the sun rise / set. 
unless the sun moved an infinite distance away on a plane parallel to the surface of our "flat" earth, we would still see the halo

[N]Nope

[O]GRAVITY

[N]Noob if the earth is flat you can see the highest buildings and mountains even if you are in america to Philippines and if the earth is flat why the ships/boats in the ocean goes far they look like going down until you can only see the flag of the boat/ship until it will dissapear

[O]Serious Question:  Are there any NON-Americans who believe in this stuff?

[O]NAH FAM ( 0001 colorized )

[O]Have you ever been in a plane, look out the window and you’ll see the curve

[O]1:34 do you know what gravity is ??

[N]You have flat earthers, Trump as President and people listening to gutter news like Alex Jones. The world is going mad.

[O]I believe it’s flat call me crazy whatever

[N]All you have to do is look up in the sky at night and take look at the moon. What shape is it? Circular. Now take a quick look at the sun during the day what shape is it? Circular. Now grab a telescope and look into the night sky and look for the different planets. What shape are they? All of them are circular. What can we conclude? The earth to is circular !!!!! Unless your a person that believes that what you see is a figment of your imagination. Or part of some conspiracy.I have a comeback for that one too. If I were to smack you across your face , would that be real, part of your imagination, or part of some conspiracy?

[O]How do ppl acc believe the earth is flat

[O]Okay for people who say the earth is flat because of a dumb airplane theory. Gravity is the answer. It's kind of very basic knowledge if you want more info since I'm not a scientist but a smart person who researches stuff http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/134-physics/general-physics/mechanics/829-why-can-t-a-plane-fly-slowly-and-let-the-earth-pass-underneath-beginner

[O]omg i'm laughing so hard at the fact that people actually believe that the earth is flat

[O]Answer me this flat-earthers if the government is lying to us about the earth bring flat don't you think china or Russia would debunk the round-earth "myth"

[O]Disregard the flat earth theory and the round earth theory, the true model of the earth is a dodecahedron smh

[N]I don't understand how idiots believed we live on a spinning ball lol

[O]Theeen....why don't we fall off?

[N]LOL... Flat Earthers are the bottom of the barrel conspiracy theorists. Go ask any professional who's job requires taking the Earth's curvature into account.

[O]Only in America

[O]If the earth is flat, then how do we have a day night cycle. If the earth qas flat it would always be day or night

[N]Flat Earth is fake!
Bc theres no such a place as Earth!

[N]The actual reasons people believe in a flat Earth:

1. They have a lack of intelligence.
2. They have a lack of sanity.
3. They have paranoia and need a conspiracy to explain their anxiety.
4. They are gullible.
5. They interpret the Bible literally.

[O]Flat earth is a myth. It's not really earth or a planet. Its really a giant domed spaceship with a matrix style reality until the "reality woke" people find us a real planet to live on. The lie about the extinction of dinosaurs was humanities near extinction.

[O]First at all why wpuld they even hide that..

[O]If earth is flat than we would run out of water and we would run of a edge when we drive a boat/plane of the edge

[O]I just came here for a good laugh was a bit down today

[O]Here's the one simple fact that flat earthers cant explain.   If the sun was hovering above the flat earth...It would shrink into the distance becoming smaller and smaller. It would never appear to slowly disappear from bottom to the top while staying the same size. Also for gravity to stay the same all over the planet the earth would either be a massive cylinder, with us on top, of it would need to be accelerating. if we were in constant acceleration...we would eventually be traveling at light speed. Also , once you reach space, regardless of what camera you use, you would be able to see China from America. No one has ever shown this..

[O]”They" certainly must know more about how the earth is flat than we do. Looking forward to the truth. Already exciting. Will get moreso.

[O]It's a Global Conspiracy!

[N]Just how STUPID are these Flat Brains????

[O]England is my city.

[O]Who here believe this is true cause I don’t

[O]1:37, answer is GRAVITY

[N]This is bull

[O]Look at the pic they take of earth there no stars in the back ground explained and explained why when we pour water on a ball it fall down but we on a ball of water impossible u can whip water around a rock or a ball it's impossible people free yo mind the reason they lie cause we on flat earth with a top yes we can't get out and that proof God is real

[N]"All these buttmad lefties in the comments, but no one is still explaining what the guy did that was illegal ?
[N]He did kill a person and injure a bunch more- but he was in a car... on a road.. while those cunts where standing on the road.

Stupid niggers block traffic on highways during chimpouts all the time if any ever get in my way I can promise you that I will turn that little knob on my dash all the way and lock my trans brake give the go pedal a push until my boost gauge climbs then with a push of the button and my foot on the pedal anything in my way will no longer be in my way and the only thing Iam stopping for is to do it again or to fuel er up.,,

[N]"I saw this on live leak... It was brutal. Still, there are idiots who support this kind of terrorism because the victims were people they want silenced and the terrorist is someone who is in the same party as them. They tolerate murder because they are too weak to accept adversity. It just goes to show how identity politics and this ""us vs them"" mentality is distracting from the bigger problems. Next time some Muslim extremist mows down a group of far right protesters, I'll be expecting every one of you to applaud the act and praise the terrorist. Freedom of speech and human rights are the bedrock of America; if you throw that out the window, you are no better than any muslim who supports sharia law, or violence against others.",,

[N]]It's the extremes on both sides that spread hate. They both want the others side to think like them and will do anything to obtain that. 
[N]Everyone who attended except the people who started it just to try and save a historical statue knew there was going to be violence. When the kkk and neo nazis came to attend you know there won t be good. Then have antifa come to makes it way worst. But I doubt anyone expected death.

Fuck that and anyone who believes other wise.",,
[N]What we are seeing in charlottesville is the price paid for Donald Trumps bigoted campaign style. By stirring up emotion in the hate filled minority he won an election. Now the price is paid.

[N]Why is this violence and rage  always occurring in States/cities with Democrat governors/Democrat mayors? They are either very weak leaders who are unable to keep the rule of  law or are trying to incite violence by ordering the police to stand down. Since that McCauliffe is one of the Mass Murderess Hildabeast's closest friends it's a good example of what the whole country would look like today if all Americans across the land had not stood up & voted en masse to keep the beast & her allies & the Jew Killer soros (who finances this chaos) out of the Office of the Presidency.,,
